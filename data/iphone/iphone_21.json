  "htmltext": "\t\t\t\t\t\tAs highlighted in a few reports <a href=\"http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=1785905\">shared in the <em>MacRumors</em> forums</a>, a small but growing number of iPhone 6 Plus owners have reportedly bent their phones after carrying the devices in their pockets just days after launch. In <a href=\"http://forums.macrumors.com/showpost.php?p=19825874&amp;postcount=1\">one instance</a>, a new iPhone 6 Plus was bent during a day of dancing, dining, and driving to a wedding.  \r<br />\n<br />\n<img src=\"http://cdn.macrumors.com/article-new/2014/09/bent-iphone6-plus.jpg\" alt=\"bent-iphone6-plus\" width=\"800\" height=\"154\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-423391\" /><center><i><a href=\"http://forums.macrumors.com/showpost.php?p=19825874&amp;postcount=1\">Photo by hanzoh</a></i></center><blockquote>Yesterday, I left at 10am with the iPhone in my left FRONT pocket of my suit pants. I drove 4 hours to a wedding, which also involved a lot of sitting during dinner etc but also 2-3 hours of dancing. I left at 2am and went to bed, driving home 4 hours back.\r<br />\n<br />\nSo in total, the 6 Plus was about 18 hours in my pocket while sitting mostly.\r<br />\n<br />\nAs I lay it on the coffee table and sat down on the couch to relax from the drive (yes, sitting again ), I saw the reflection of the window in the iPhones slightly distorted. </blockquote>This potential for bending is of course not unique to the iPhone 6 Plus, with reports of bent <a href=\"http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=1452478\">iPhone 5</a> and <a href=\"http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=1754349\">5s handsets</a> surfacing in the past few years. As iPhones get thinner and larger, however, storage of the handset in a pocket becomes riskier. Unlike smaller phones that can slide out of the way, pressure points from sitting or bending now have greater potential to cause the longer iPhone to flex in a way that will damage the device.  \r<br />\n<br />\n<img src=\"http://cdn.macrumors.com/article-new/2014/09/bent_iphone_6_plus.jpg\" alt=\"bent_iphone_6_plus\" width=\"704\" height=\"295\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-423400\" /><center><i><a href=\"http://forums.macrumors.com/showpost.php?p=19826437&amp;postcount=41\">Photo by DevinPitcher</a></i></center> <br />\nTo prevent bending, iPhone 6 Plus owners may want to remove their iPhones from their pockets before sitting or bending. If a pocket is unavoidable, then customers may want to place their device in a roomier pocket that allows the device to slide out the way. A rigid case may also provide protection from flexing or bending, as well damage from dropping the device. <br /><br /><div class=\"linkback\">Related roundup: <a href=\"http://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-6/\">iPhone 6</a> </div>\n<div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n",

The HTC One M8 is the only phone that comes close to the iPhone 6 in terms of build quality and was up there with the other androids in specs.

The predictable screams of a minute fraction of new owners saying things like they are getting bad battery life is also meaningless and will die down after a few phones have been replaced and the first iOS 8 patch comes out.

Just too much government involvement and regulation that destroys businesses all in the name of politicians power to spend money with no recourse.\r\n\n",

It's no different than a kid covering up a story so they don't get in trouble. These people likely did something dumb with their phone in their pocket and now are attempting to make it look like a manufacturing defect because they want it replaced.  Similar to someone spilling water in their phone and then trying to say they answered the phone in the rain and it stopped working. There is a reason Apple and pretty much any phone manufacturer doesn't accept this type of story and offer a free replacement.  Now if 10,000 others come forward then there is an issue, but right now it's not even a legitimate story.<br />\n<br />\nIn an unrelated story I kept a Snickers bar in my back pocket during a 30 minute car ride. After parking I went to eat it and found it smashed and melted.  Clearly they aren't making these correctly.\r\n\n",

Finally he accepted it and gave me a loaner. When it came back and he put it on the table for me to inspect, it was noticeably bent and the resulting stress in the screen was causing backlight flare. I complained, we checked the paperwork and to Apple's credit, they changed the phone for a refurb. So it is not a unique problem of the 6, but putting that monster in a front pants pocket is asking for trouble! How often have you put a wallet in a front pants pocket for security and struggled to get it out when needing it. There is tremendous strain in that bend angle when sitting.\r\n\n",

Take care of your device and it will work and look great for the entire two + years.

My 9 year old daughter managed to not bend a 5 she's been using for over a year yet others here on MR couldn't get through a week without bending theirs..... So is it really a &quot;design flaw&quot; or users being irresponsible with their $800 device?  <br />\n<br />\r\nAs far as &quot;can't be pocketed&quot;..... I've been pocketing my 6+ daily sense I got it last Friday....... Working, driving, even ran down the street with it in my pocket and guess what? Yep, no bending. Wife has been pocketing her iPhones sense they came out including the 6..... Never bent one and she is a 32 year old woman that wears her shorts on the tight side.  How is it two (4 if you want to add my 9 and 11 year old kids) normal, typical humans can manage to use their phones daily for years without bending them yet others can't go a week?  Again is it a flaw in the design or users being irresponsible?  I go with the latter.\r\n\n",

How is it two (4 if you want to add my 9 and 11 year old kids) normal, typical humans can manage to use their phones daily for years without bending them yet others can't go a week?

That's so funny. Fortunately, as noted, stickers still on it so will return for full refund. Sorry to burst your precious little iPhone bubble. If you want an iPhone that doesn't meet traditional Apple product tolerances, go right ahead. For me to want this phone now, it will have to be discounted. Check my pictures before you make lame jokes. This is a phone that was only handled by me as if it were a mint Wayne Gretzky rookie card (because I was going to sell it).\r\n\n",

It is definitely a design problem for a device which is otherwise beautifully designed.<br />\n<br />\nI only made this account after seeing reports of others getting it too, so wanted to warn people before they crack their screens too!

Thickness isn't really a huge factor at this point, and the space could have been put to good use.  I'd be really tempted by a 6+ right about now if they had made it 2mm thicker and used the space for enough battery to last a couple days.  That's one of the three things I actually miss about my old Note 3 -- the big display was awesome, the high resolution digitizer had it's moments, and the battery life was great.

Try a more realistic story. You drive an SUV. <br />\n<br />\nYou have a deeply pitched driveway hill from the main road. You also  drive in snow a lot. <br />\n<br />\nYou buy an expensive sporty (non SUV) Corvette or Ferrari. Now you find that your low front scoop/ bumper bottoms out up your driveway or your low road clearance prevents you from driving in high snow. <br />\n<br />\nIs that the expensive car's fault? Or did you not think things through correctly?<br />\n<br />\nHaving 1-3 report a bending problem out of 10 million is not a problem any car company would respond too. They'd say you need the all terrain package- a tough rigid case by analogy.</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</div>Don't think that this is quite comparable. A Ferrari is for a complete different purpose than a SUV. Everyone knows that and it is also obvious.<br />\nBut if I develop only 2 different car variants and want them to be suitable for a lot of people, than I have to assure that these also work for all thinkable or at least most thinkable occasions. In this comparison it would have to include snow.<br />\n<br />\nOtherwise I cannot whine when only a special group is buying my products, like race drivers. But then I've made a product tailored to their desires.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nImagine the car is too high for a downtown parking garage an now I'm  telling you to leave the car at home, take the bus or whatever, because it was not made to go to a parking garage downtown...<br />\nIt's only purpose is to drive on free roads, have a shiny outer appearance and some find leather inside, great gps and whatsoever.<br />\nSorry, but being carried in a jeans pocket is one of the key purposes of a phone. Then the goal from Apple was completely wrong by offering only two choices, 6 and 6 plus.<br />\nI was fine with the size of my 4S, the robustness and everything. Just all the software upgrades from Apple you cannot evade have made it nearly as slow and un unusable after 3 years. No environmental influences have lead me to buy a new one\r\n\n",

But nearly all sedans today have introduced low profile front air scoops. And indeed I have such a steep driveway and deep snow that it is seriously something I examine. There are Honda sedans that just don't work. Period. <br />\n<br />\nYou can say I'm the exception. But so far I've only seen 1-3 examples of bent iPhones. Out of 10 million sold. <br />\n<br />\nI have had every iPhone including the 5&amp;5S. I use bumpers or thin cases and carry it only in my front pocket every day. No bent phones,ever. I have had the iPhone 6 since launch, in my front pocket, and it's fine. <br />\n<br />\nIf you want a thin 5.5&quot; phablet then think about how you treat it. If I'm going to be careless with a phone , like a water sport, fishing or a day in the beach I slip it into a life proof case.  <br />\n<br />\nA lot of speculations here for a problem that has little statistics to support it. Don't expect any company to address this without more documented incidences.\r\n\n",

He could have very well had a 9 year old child sitting on his lap during the wedding that he forgot about.  He could have been leaning over a sink with his phone on the edge that he didn't even notice.  <br />\n<br />\nSecond of all, that's not the way the phone was bent.  The bend doesn't follow the curvature of a leg - there's not enough force.  The only way there's enough force to bend the phone the way it was shown in the photo is if somehow his pocket and where the phone rests was over the bending point between your leg and your pelvis/waist.  Even then, it's highly implausible.  Why? ...<br />\n<br />\nYou need a fulcrum point.  Anyone who's taken basic physics understands this.  Note in the bending videos, the two thumbs provides that fulcrum point.  In your front pocket, where is that fulcrum?  The cloth on your pants?  Seriously?  Prove me wrong - try to bend your phone without placing your thumbs on the back of the phone.<br />\n<br />\nWhat I'm saying is, try it out for yourself to assess the real-life risk of this happening.  Is there any torque being applied to YOUR phone as it sits in your front pocket when you sit?  My argument is that this doesn't happen to the vast majority of people and without a fulcrum point.  This has nothing to do with the curvature of your leg.  <img src=\"http://cdn.macrumors.com/vb/images/smilies/rolleyes.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" title=\"Roll Eyes (Sarcastic)\" class=\"inlineimg\" /> <br />\n<br />\nOn a final note - the level of critical thinking in this forum is depressing.  This reminds me of all the people online who insisted there was a critical design flaw with the Tesla Model S last year when a guy in Washington hit a large piece of metal shrapnel on the highway and a fire started in the battery pack.  Nobody was hurt and the car performed exactly as designed, protecting the driver from the flames.  But somehow, it became the hottest topic on wall street, stock forums, and car forums for the next month - &quot;Is Tesla doomed??&quot;  Hysteria apparently has no use for logic.\r\n\n",

The bend doesn't follow the curvature of a leg - there's not enough force.  The only way there's enough force to bend the phone the way it was shown in the photo is if somehow his pocket and where the phone rests was over the bending point between your leg and your pelvis/waist.  Even then, it's highly implausible.  Why? ...<br />\n<br />\nYou need a fulcrum point.  Anyone who's taken basic physics understands this.  Note in the bending videos, the two thumbs provides that fulcrum point.  In your front pocket, where is that fulcrum?  The cloth on your pants?  Seriously?  Prove me wrong - try to bend your phone without placing your thumbs on the back of the phone.<br />\n<br />\nWhat I'm saying is, try it out for yourself to assess the real-life risk of this happening.  Is there any torque being applied to YOUR phone as it sits in your front pocket when you sit?  My argument is that this doesn't happen to the vast majority of people and without a fulcrum point.  This has nothing to do with the curvature of your leg.  <img src=\"http://cdn.macrumors.com/vb/images/smilies/rolleyes.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" title=\"Roll Eyes (Sarcastic)\" class=\"inlineimg\" /> <br />\n.......</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</div>If the front pockets are large enough, and the phone moved horizontally in the pocket, the thigh becomes the fulcrum point.  <br />\n<br />\nNow imagine bending down with a phone horizontally in your front pocket, your thigh muscles will be stiff and the pants will pull tight down over the two ends of the phone.  Also consider that the skinnier your legs are the more concentrated the force will be at the fulcrum.  That scenario seems very plausible to me.\r\n\n",
