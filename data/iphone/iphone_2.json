That's not 'sitting on your phone'. That's 'having it in your pocket'. This 'bendgate' wasn't anywhere near as much of a problem with the earlier iPhone models. <br />\n<br />\r\nYet you find a way to claim that it's the fault of the users.

He's the best designer on the planet bar none. This case is clearly user error. Nobody stupid enough to put their big phones in their front pockets or rear ones either. Well maybe the 1 person who broke his phone on YouTube. The rest are just delusional. <br />\n<br />\r\nApple doesn't make products they don't first test thoroughly. The 8.0.1 fiasco was due to the error of one of the qa engineers at apple who made a simple mistake any Google company does on a daily basis <br />\n<br />\r\nAnd 1 case out of 10 million is hardly headline worthy. Apple still makes the best smartphone and there are no competitors.\r\n\n",

That's the craziest part about all of this. The story (originated by none other than MACRUMORS themselves) was run without any proof or actual testing done.  It was just based off 3 or 4 iPhone 6 Plus owners who claimed theirs bent from normal usage without anything to prove whether it was true or they sat on their devices or what.  The rest of the media then ran with the story after Macrumors ran it and now we're here.<br />\n<br />\nNot to say that those users are liars but the proper journalistic and scientific thing to do would've been to drive around with the phone squeezed into tight jeans for several hours to see if the problem could be replicated a few times and if it could, then run the story.  So far I've yet to see such a test.<br />\n<br />\nOn the topic, HTC's was pretty funny. I'll say they're the one Android OEM who is as good as or better than Apple when it comes to hardware.\r\n\n",

If one watches the &quot;scientific&quot; videos, the phone will bend under an absurd amount of pressure at the weakest point of the phone. Just like you can damage my BMW 5 Series if you apply an absurd amount of pressure at critical points on the door and most of the interior controls. I keep my iPhone 6+ in my front left pocket routinely and there have been no issues. Just to see how much my phone would flex, I applied pressure to it. It flexed but it did not deform permanently. I applied substantial pressure to it. The iPhone is awesome and it is expensive. I would never think of not treating it thoughtfully. The iPhone 6+, like my BMW 5 Series, will break if misused or intentionally abused. Under normal use for 6 days the phone has been awesome and exceeded my expectations.\r\n\n",

Even if it were true that only idiots that abuse their iPhones are bending them (and it isn't true), the other manufacturers of similarly-sized devices are not having &quot;bendgates&quot; of their own. Therefore Apple rightly deserves to be mocked and raked over the coals for what is, at the very least in comparison to other manufacturers, a very serious engineering screw-up. Even if one could objectively say that it isn't a design flaw (and it most certainly is), they have put out a product that is weaker than their competitors products and made themselves look quite foolish in the marketplace. Apple fans should consider that to be unacceptable on the part of Apple, rather than being obnoxiously dismissive of the concerns of the market. The many thousands of bent iPhones that will soon be in the wild will each be excellent advertisements for Samsung. Is that what you want? It matters little how they became bent, only that they are bent, and they aren't being bent on purpose (except for that one idiot on YouTube). The people accidentally bending them are fellow Apple/iPhone fans, not idiots and deliberate saboteurs. <br />\n<br />\r\nIf you are truly Apple fans and want to have even more excellent iPhones in the future, which the competition cannot mock even if they try, it is only logical to join the chorus of those who are acknowledging and mocking bendgate. Let the competitors have their day (month/year) of gloating and mocking. Help Apple learn the lesson that they strayed a bit too far this time in the pursuit of thinness and lightness, without paying sufficient attention to durability for the product's intended purpose of being a personal phone that you carry with you at all times. If it is not suited for that purpose next time they should market the Plus as a smaller iPad mini that can coincidentally make phone calls, not as an iPhone.\r\n\n",

Even if it were true that only idiots that abuse their iPhones are bending them (and it isn't true), the other manufacturers of similarly-sized devices are not having &quot;bendgates&quot; of their own. Therefore Apple rightly deserves to be mocked and raked over the coals for what is, at the very least in comparison to other manufacturers, a very serious engineering screw-up. Even if one could objectively say that it isn't a design flaw (and it most certainly is), they have put out a product that is weaker than their competitors products and made themselves look quite foolish in the marketplace. Apple fans should consider that to be unacceptable on the part of Apple, rather than being obnoxiously dismissive of the concerns of the market. The many thousands of bent iPhones that will soon be in the wild will each be excellent advertisements for Samsung. Is that what you want? It matters little how they became bent, only that they are bent, and they aren't being bent on purpose (except for that one idiot on YouTube). The people accidentally bending them are fellow Apple/iPhone fans, not idiots and deliberate saboteurs. <br />\n<br />\r\nIf you are truly Apple fans and want to have even more excellent iPhones in the future, which the competition cannot mock even if they try, it is only logical to join the chorus of those who are acknowledging and mocking bendgate. Let the competitors have their day (month/year) of gloating and mocking. Help Apple learn the lesson that they strayed a bit too far this time in the pursuit of thinness and lightness, without paying sufficient attention to durability for the product's intended purpose of being a personal phone that you carry with you at all times. If it is not suited for that purpose next time they should market the Plus as a smaller iPad mini that can coincidentally make phone calls, not as an iPhone.</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</div><div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:5px; \">\n<div class=\"smallfont\" style=\"margin-bottom:2px\">Quote:</div>\n<table cellpadding=\"6\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\" width=\"100%\">\n<tr>\n<td class=\"alt2\" style=\"border:1px inset\">\n<div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tOriginally Posted by <strong>iBug2</strong>\n<a href=\"showthread.php?p=19904910#post19904910\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img class=\"inlineimg\" src=\"http://cdn.macrumors.com/vb/images/buttons/viewpost.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"View Post\" /></a>\n</div>\n<div style=\"font-style:italic\">Apple should be really worrying if it's indeed that many.</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</div>Indeed they should, and indeed there will be. Consider the following:<br />\n<br />\r\n1. There will soon be tens of millions of iPhone 6 Plus units in the wild in the next several months. Based on some preliminary data I estimate they will be around 10% to 20% of total iPhone 6 sales. Therefore, tens of millions. <br />\n<br />\r\n2. Many bent i6+ units will wind up with cracked screens, and thus be very likely to be rejected by Apple &quot;Geniuses&quot; for warranty replacement. <br />\n<br />\r\n3. Many users with bent i6+ units will have already stretched their budget to get them and will not be able to afford to pay for a non-covered replacement (or AppleCare, for that matter, which might have allowed them to replace it for $79). <br />\n<br />\r\nErgo, I believe it's a very safe bet to say that within a few months there will be <b>many thousands</b> of bent iPhone 6 Plus units in the wild that Apple will refuse to replace and users cannot afford to replace until their contract expires. Possibly even many tens of thousands eventually. Probably still a fairly small percentage of the overall number of units sold, but each one will be in the wild for months or even years, and each one will be a terrible, negative advertisement for Apple's supposed build quality for anyone who sees it. <br />\n<br />\r\nApple deserves the mockery it is receiving, and it will unfortunately go on for years, long after it is actually relevant.\r\n\n",

I remember my days from crappy Note 2, 3 cases, couldn't believe they were charging the same price as iPod accessories.<br />\n<br />\nNow here's my question though. How big is your pants supposed to be to put iPhone 6+ in your front pocket? iPhone was like the only phone that I could get into my front pockets, so I couldn't put any of my Galaxy note in pockets.</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</div>If people bought phones strictly on design I think the M8 would be a much bigger success than it is.  People buy Apple more bc of iOS and I miss iOS at times.  I'm hopeful that the new Android L fixes some things I don't like but if it doesn't and Apple fixes their poor batteries and makes stronger case, I'll likely switch back when the 6S comes out.  I considered the 6 until I heard of the issues with battery and bending.  <br />\n<br />\nI'm about as fair as they come.  I miss iOS but Apple needs to catch up on battery life.  My brother and I unplugged at the same time and we hung out all day watching sports and responding to texts and looking up scores last Sunday and My M8 outlasted his brand new 6 by almost 2 1/2 hours.\r\n\n",

Can't compare. I can put a tiny piece of cardboard in my pocket and it wouldn't bend. I put a huge piece of cardboard and it will bend because it doesn't fit in the pocket. <br />\n<br />\r\n2.

It does not bend when you just walk around. WTF is with everyone just saying that they walk with it in their pocket and somehow magically bends 90 degrees. It bends when a heavy person sits on it, or has it in their front pocket and uncomfortably has it poke their thighs until it breaks/bends<br />\n<br />\r\n4.

Mobile devices should be tough and durable.  They are not desk ornaments like a computer, they need to hold up in the rough and tumble of daily life.  I believe most if not all current smart phones are insufficiently durable, but the 6+ appears to be the worst despite costing the most.  You are focusing on size when you need to look at the intended use of a product.  <br />\n<br />\r\n@3:  These 6+ phones are bending in both front and rear pockets.  But unless you sit on a hard surface, why should a phone permanently bend even if it's in a rear pocket?  Why would anyone find such flimsiness acceptable on such an expensive <i>mobile</i> device?  On some cheap Android device I could understand, but Apple's flagship phone should be better.  BTW they are bending in front pockets as well as rear, and not only in tight jeans.<br />\n<br />\r\n@4:  If Apple don't expect phones to take abuse, then that could explain the current designs.  More likely, I think it's Ive who doesn't expect his designs to compromise with the real world, and nobody at Apple can or will veto his judgement.\r\n\n",

Right now, most iPhone 6 users have not heard about bending issues (whig I think are way overblown) so why bother to make it a big deal? All that does is add legitimacy to the attacks and allow them to reach a wider audience.<br />\n<br />\r\nAs for bending, the original bend video shows it takes a lot of force to bend one although the exact amount is unknown since it wasn't done using a test rig. I'd bet applying a similar amount of force to other phones would bend or break them as well. <br />\n<br />\r\nFinally, yes, if you sit on your phone you risk damaging it.\r\n\n",
