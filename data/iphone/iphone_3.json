  "htmltext": "\t\t\t\t\t\tApple's iPhone 6 Plus has been receiving a huge amount of attention over the last day, following reports of users seeing <a href=\"http://www.macrumors.com/2014/09/23/iphone-6-plus-bending-pockets/\">significant bending</a> after placing the phone in a pocket.\r<br />\n<br />\nA video made yesterday <a href=\"http://www.macrumors.com/2014/09/23/iphone-6-plus-bend-video/\">demonstrated</a>  just how far the iPhone 6 Plus is able to bend, and now the video's creator, Lewis Hilsenteger of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IROcoJeVfSI\">Unbox Therapy</a>, has created a second video to test the iPhone 6 and several other Android devices.\r<br />\n<br />\nThe smaller 4.7-inch iPhone 6 appears to be much less malleable than the larger iPhone 6 Plus. While the iPhone 6 Plus bent significantly near the volume buttons under the force inflicted by Hilsenteger, he is unable to do as much damage to the iPhone 6. Aside from a small dent, the phone remains intact. \"This one is far more durable,\" he says.\r<br />\n<br />\n<center><div id=\"video-wrapper\"><div id=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/IROcoJeVfSI?feature=player_detailpage\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div></div></center> <br />\nBased on his preliminary testing, Hilsenteger does not believe that iPhone 6 users will see the same issues that some iPhone 6 Plus users are seeing in regards to bending. As we noted yesterday, it's unlikely that the force Hilsenteger used in the original video will be replicated inside of a pocket, but photos of bent iPhone 6 Plus devices have suggested that it does not take much force to cause a slight curvature in the device.\r<br />\n<br />\nBending issues are not limited to the iPhone 6 Plus, as bending has been seen in prior versions of the iPhone, including the iPhone 5 and 5s.\r<br />\n<br />\nApple has not commented on the iPhone 6 Plus bending incidents, but iPhone 6 Plus owners can likely prevent bending by removing the phone from their pockets before sitting or by placing the device in a rigid protective case.<br /><br /><div class=\"linkback\">Related roundup: <a href=\"http://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-6/\">iPhone 6</a> </div>\n<div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n",

There is no flaw in the iPhone 6 bending this is just a extremely minor case of some irresponsible adults not taking care of a product. Or they are apple haters probably paid by samsung to give some sort of bad press. Just kidding on the last one but never know anything wouldn't surprise me. Im actually surprised this is making news, i know many americans or people for that matter are irresponsible and dumb but my god this is just sad that there are people so irresponsible that are breeding in the world too. Is outterbox going to make a case for their babies next so they don't drop and bend them. If you disagree and think this could be a real problem without people putting severe force on the phone then you maybe take a look in the mirror and think of how you can acquire some common sense. If I'm wrong and this turns out to be a real problem i will eat my words but i am 100% positive this will blow over and be nothing within 2-4 days once people see how much force is required to make it bend\r\n\n",

There are a lot of people here with Apple tinted glasses. All my gear is Apple, I am an Apple fan, and while the tests are primitive, they do confirm the many many, many reports of bending. The Note 3 flexes a little, and goes back to shape, the 6 Plus bends and stays bent. Seems to me they took the thinner and lighter too far, and have not tested the chassis.\r\n\n",

I can only think of it being uncomfortable, and can definitely see potential for it to damage a $1000+ (AUD, unlocked) electronic device!!!<br />\n<br />\r\nPOSSIBLE SOLUTIONS!!!!!<br />\r\n1) Firstly, bend an android, so that you can learn that bending phones MAY cause damage/complete failure of the device. BENDERS BEWARE!!!<br />\n<br />\r\n2) Unless you still have a pair of cargos from the 90s or like wearing baggy army pants, DON'T put your phablet into your pocket. It will be uncomfortable and MAY cause damage to the phone when you sit down/bend (funnily enough). HIPSTERS WITH CHINOS (or whatever you call them, tight pants in weird colours with elastic down the bottom)... NO!! DON'T EVEN TRY FORCING A PHABLET INTO THOSE POCKETS!! NO!! STOP IT!!! Little asian girls with size 6 pants and phablets bigger than their heads... same story! Put it in your handbag!!<br />\n<br />\r\n3) On that note everybody... before buyin a phablet, THINK!! They are MF huge!! I find my iPhone 6 MF huge!! I didn't buy a phablet... a] because they are too big to use with 1 hand, and; b] because I knew I'd need a man bag to carry one. Don't buy a phablet without a man bag, a handbag, baggy cargos, rapper jeans or an 80's belt clip!!! <br />\n<br />\r\nRemember the belt clip? Phones used to be this big!! Why did we make them bigger again? I DON'T KNOW!!! However, back in the 80's you'd clip your massive phone onto your belt and look like a tool. Phablets are the same size as these old bricks, so the same carrying considerations apply.\r\n\n",

People didn't carry their 1980s phones in their pockets because they were too big so would have fallen out and broken.<br />\n<br />\r\n---<br />\n<br />\r\nBreaking news... [insert Apple device] gets broken when you mistreat it and fail to use common sense.<br />\n<br />\r\nCould apply to any advice. Laptops are for shoving in bags right? Try stuffing a 17&quot; MacBook Pro into a backpack that's full of heavy law books that's bulging because it's so full and ride home on a bike. Even if you have a decent case, your MBP will more than likely suffer damage.<br />\n<br />\r\nYes people WANT to shove laptops into their bags for study, but you've gotta take care of them. I sometimes find myself in this position and have to either remove books from the bag (leave them at the library) or walk home, holding my MBP (which is 15&quot;) in my hand.<br />\n<br />\r\nPeople have had expensive electronic devices with screens bigger than 5&quot; for aaaages!!! Most even have a 'do not bend' instruction in the manual. There's a reason why!\r\n\n",

A holster, besides being a device from the 90s, is a real thief magnet. I doubt than I would keep the device in my property more than a month with a holster with iPhones being the #1 target of thieves... If the phone is not against your body, it's a lot easier to steal. The front pocket remains the best protection: you have skin contact, it's in front of your body, it's in an area where most male are very perceptive of hand contact... <br />\r\nGiven the choice, I would much rather have my iPhone bent than stolen, it's cheaper to replace.<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:5px; \">\n<div class=\"smallfont\" style=\"margin-bottom:2px\">Quote:</div>\n<table cellpadding=\"6\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\" width=\"100%\">\n<tr>\n<td class=\"alt2\" style=\"border:1px inset\">\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tFrankly I don't care if the iPhone 6 plus is for a briefcase, purse, holstered or in a hard case\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</div>Well, I do. Having a phone in a backpack or a briefcase means that you can't feel it vibrate - and thus that you're going to miss all your calls. That's a problem for phone... It also means that the device is harder to reach for, and the value of a smartphone is instant access (otherwise I would carry a Macbook Air and a regular phone). <br />\r\nAnd size is also important, because that would mean I could stop carrying both my 4S and my Nexus 7 (which never bent despite being much bigger than the 6+ and occasionally being in my pocket).\r\n\n",

The only publicity this has gotten is a video of a guy that almost broke his fingers trying to bend the phone and a picture of a bent phone that someone claims was in their pocket. I have mine in my pocket and was at the gym doing lounges. No got bent. My guess would be the guy sat on it while in his back pocket. I've seen plenty of phones break this way. Break not bend though. <br />\n<br />\r\nAnd I am a shareholder. Invested before iPhone #1 came out. not much, but enough right now <img src=\"http://cdn.macrumors.com/vb/images/smilies/smile.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" title=\"Smilie\" class=\"inlineimg\" /><br />\n<br />\r\nNow what I'm surprised at is no one is mentioning just how crazy buggy iOS 8 is so far. Obviously the bricking of 8.0.1, which they recalled. That's crazy. Not sure how that went through QA\r\n\n",

Apple has done enough fibbing throughout the years, denying many a problem, so I'm not about to join in.</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</div>I'm not defending anything except for my choice to not keep a phone in my pocket while sitting (front or back, still puts pressure on the phone, not to mention my leg).  I find it uncomfortable.  Hence my answer to the original question, which was would 6+ owners be exchanging for a 6.<br />\n<br />\r\nIf the 6+ doesn't fit the lifestyle of certain people (ie, those who feel they must carry a phone in their pockets no matter how much stress they place on the phone), then clearly they should purchase a phone that is designed for that.  Or use a honking big case.<br />\n<br />\r\nHaving said that, there are plenty of people in the forum, men and women, who are very happy with their 6+ and not having problems.  People just don't have as much interest in the non-controversial.\r\n\n",

I don't understand what's the discussion here, people talking about cases ext. A phone shouldn't bend in your pockets, especially a premium phone that costs a load of money. It shouldn't and the videos prove that the 6+ is the most bendable among the top smartphones. It's just embarrassing, even more so than the awful design (protruding camera, the antenna lines, big ass bezels).<br />\r\nI'm utterly disappointed with the &quot;sixes&quot;. I'll probably get the 6 somewhere along the line, because my iPhone 4S is getting too small and underpowered, but man I wish I could wait for iPhone 7 - guess the 6S will be the same kind of monstrosity. Maybe at iPhone 7 they'll make the big iPhone without a protruding camera and without the unnecessary bezels. <br />\r\nWhereas iPhone 4S looked like a phone from the future, the iPhone 6 looks like a phone from the past. But not the &quot;vintage&quot; kind of past...\r\n\n",

First off, I said that this would happen [by the laws of physics] given any smartphone that is made of a malleable metal such as aluminum and especially when it is paired with such a thin device. Nowhere did I defend Apple - nor would I ever feel the need or desire to do that. All I said was that it is amazing to me that people cannot understand that this would happen by putting pressure on a device [no matter a cellular device, a calculator, etc] with such characteristics. Read posts <i>before</i> you start ******-talking on what you <i>think</i> the author means.<br />\n<br />\nAlso, I am not saying that this should happen with a cell phone, because obviously we would like for it to be able to withstand whatever pressure we want to put onto it (which <i>normal</i> can range dramatically depending on the person), but materials and designs have limits.

And that appears to be where they start bending.<br />\n<br />\r\nA lot can be said about this. First, people do really dumb things with their devices. There is only so much abuse any device can take and people seem to think their gadgets are indestructible, or just don't think at all. Almost any smartphone you see owned by a person under the age of 18, has a broken or spider-webbed glass front. I see it all the time. So, a little common sense is in order, and I don't think this is as big a problem as it's being made out to be.<br />\n<br />\r\nBut, having said that... Apple could've built a slightly thicker and perhaps, stronger phone. When the 6 first came out, and I saw the protruding camera lens, I thought this is a little too much. Apple has an unhealthy obsession with thinness. With every new product comes a video by Ive that usually has the word &quot;thin&quot; in the first sentence. I really don't think users are concerned with a millimeter or two, but Apple certainly is. While I appreciate their design philosophy to get things as thin as possible, I don't want them to lose sight of function over form.<br />\n<br />\r\nI love Apple products, I got my Apple factory tech certification in 1986 and have been in IT since the early '90's. I'm not a design engineer, so perhaps a millimeter or two wouldn't have made any difference. But sometimes I worry they make thin products just for sake of being thin.<br />\n<br />\r\nI'm currently a happy 5s owner, and since I'm on the &quot;s&quot; track, perhaps the 6s will take some cues from this current design and build in a little extra strength and durability.

I'm a broken record on this.<br />\n<br />\r\nThe phone does not need support parallel to the back but rather transverse.  Magnesium 1mm *thin* bonded to the inner sides of the aluminum would do it.

That's what aluminum is.<br />\n<br />\r\nI'm talking about the current iphone without design change and the only practical way is a thin (as I said above) piece of steel in the back of the case.  The steel would help the strength of the phone, check the 5c, and while magnesium would be good steel would help a lot.  Bending the current phone would be significantly harder inside a case reinforced by a thin sheet of steel,it would definitely be much stronger than aluminum alone.  I bet the 6 pus is easier to bend than if you took the sheet of reinforcement steel out the 5c and tried to bend it.  Both together would make a difference.\r\n\n",
