"title":"Sapphires Durability Put to the Test HeadtoHead Against Gorilla Glass  Mac Rumors","author":"Kelly_Hodgkins",
"date":"Friday August 29, 2014 9:25 am PDT",
"htmltext":"\t\t\t\t\t\tRepair experts at uBreakiFix have examined the <a href=\"http://www.ubreakifix.com/blog/sapphire-screen-drop-test-the-kyocera-brigadier/\">impact resistance</a>, scratch resistance and <a href=\"http://www.ubreakifix.com/blog/sapphire-vs-gorilla-glass-bending-and-impact/\">strength</a> of sapphire glass in a series of tests that <a href=\"http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sapphire-vs-gorilla-glass-in-ubreakifix-drop-tests-273164541.html\">were published</a> today. The tests were designed to determine whether sapphire is suitable for use as a smartphone display.\r<br />\n<br />\n<img src=\"http://cdn.macrumors.com/article-new/2014/08/glass-sapphire.png\" alt=\"glass-sapphire\" width=\"688\" height=\"303\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-420634\" /> <br />\nThe repair technicians conducted three different tests -- a scratch resistance comparison using a tungsten carbide drill bit, a  <a href=\"http://youtu.be/YmM8p2hx3k8\">drop test</a> with the sapphire display of the newly released Kyocera Brigadier, and a <a href=\"http://youtu.be/kVQbu_BsZ9o\">a four-point bend test</a> to compare the failure stress and strain of sapphire glass with that of Gorilla Glass. \r<br />\n<br />\n<center><div id=\"video-wrapper\"><div id=\"video-container\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/YmM8p2hx3k8\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div></div></center> <br />\nThe results of uBreakiFix's tests show that sapphire is significantly more scratch resistant and 25 percent stronger than Gorilla Glass, but it is much more susceptible to impacts due to its brittleness. The glass is so brittle that it shattered the first time it was dropped face down from a height of only three feet. \r<br />\n<br />\n<center><div id=\"video-wrapper\"><div id=\"video-container\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/kVQbu_BsZ9o\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div></div></center> <br />\nThe technicians conclude that sapphire does not necessarily offer any advantage over Gorilla Glass, as the material's superior scratch resistance and strength is offset by its low impact resistance. Phone manufacturers that include a sapphire display may choose to employ other protective measures such as a raised bezel to help protect the phone during impact with other surfaces. \r<br />\n<br />\nApple is partnering with GT Advanced Technologies <a href=\"http://www.macrumors.com/2013/11/05/a-look-at-how-gt-advanced-makes-sapphire-glass-for-smartphone-displays/\">to produce sapphire</a> for use in future products. The exact details on how Apple will use the material is not known, but the company is rumored to be using sapphire as <a href=\"http://www.macrumors.com/2014/08/22/gt-advanced-sapphire-display-amount-iphone6/\">a display cover</a> in future iPhone models and <a href=\"http://www.macrumors.com/2014/07/15/three-iwatch-models-high-end-sapphire/\">possibly</a> its iWatch wearable product. <br /><br /><div class=\"linkback\">Related roundup: <a href=\"http://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-6/\">iPhone 6</a> </div>\n<div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n",

Saphire is well known for being brittle due to it's hardness, so it makes a terrible choice for phones, especially given how much drama there was over the iphone screen smashings when they first came out.  This is why some tool watches (such as pro dive watches and the world famous Omega Speedmaster Pros used in space made a point of NOT using saphire due to the fact they had to be super tough).<br />\n<br />\r\nA few of my watches sapphire Crystal on them, and they are insanely scratch resistant, but also pretty strong when it comes to knocks. I've twatted them off metal door handles running through a door a few times and they have stood up fine, but then we're talking about a 3-4 mm thick lens.  Something as thin as an untreated phone face would crack pretty much instantly when dropped.<br />\n<br />\r\nSo this is most likely to be used for the watches instead.<br />\n<br />\r\nUnless they have some super sneaky new technique of laminating it , but even then the sapphire would HAVE to be the outside facing layer for the scratch resistancey to work. But even with a very tough laminated layer that is resistant to breaking I think saphire would have more drawbacks than advantages on a device that can be dropped.<font color=\"#808080\"><br />\n<br />\n----------<br />\n<br />\n</font><div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:5px; \">\n<div class=\"smallfont\" style=\"margin-bottom:2px\">Quote:</div>\n<table cellpadding=\"6\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\" width=\"100%\">\n<tr>\n<td class=\"alt2\" style=\"border:1px inset\">\n<div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tOriginally Posted by <strong>APlotdevice</strong>\n<a href=\"showthread.php?p=19547162#post19547162\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img class=\"inlineimg\" src=\"http://cdn.macrumors.com/vb/images/buttons/viewpost.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"View Post\" /></a>\n</div>\n<div style=\"font-style:italic\">The surface area is also smaller, which means fewer possible points of failure.</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</div>Exactly.

Using thin layers allows some flexibility in most of the aforementioned materials, and doping of said material means the world (carbon in steel, for example). The better questions to ask: Is it pure alumina? Laminated or not? Bonded to silicates? Plastic? With what bonding agent(s)?<br />\n<br />\r\nThose answers will more thoroughly determine its flexibility as they have profound differences on the various force moduli.<br />\n<br />\r\n[SNIP]<br />\n<br />\r\nAs I mentioned before, doping means quite a bit. I'm med chem, so I don't know materials science very well, but a lot of materials considered &quot;inflexible&quot; do have a fair amount of elastic give. You can start to alter Young's modulus with small % changes in composition, as shown here for base glass. Unsurprisingly, bulk sapphire has a much higher Young's modulus (345 GPa according to here, but again it comes back to composition and bonding to substrate -- are they even using pure alumina?<br />\n<br />\r\nI would love for someone with a materials chemistry background to clarify all this.<br />\n<br />\r\nEDIT: For reference, I also looked up Corning's Willow Glass, which is marketed as flexible substrate glass. It has a nominal E of 70-80Gpa, though it is borosilicate glass so its more shatter prone. Unsurprisingly, Corning recommends using Gorilla glass as its bonded cover glass, which clearly doesn't impact the flexibility too much.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</div>\n\n",
