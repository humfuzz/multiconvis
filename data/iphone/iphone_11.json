"title":"First iPhone 5c Reviews: Color is a Breath of Fresh Air Will Sell Like Hot Cakes  Mac Rumors","author":"Juli_Clover",
"date":"Tuesday September 17, 2014 7:49 pm PDT",
"htmltext":"\t\t\t\t\t\tDuring its iPhone event that took place on September 10, Apple handed out a number of iPhone 5c review units to various publications. The embargo on reviews has just been lifted, which means a slew of sites are posting reactions to Apple\u2019s colorful new phone lineup. We\u2019ve gathered some interesting excerpts below to highlight the general reaction to the release.\r<br />\n<br />\n<img src=\"http://cdn.macrumors.com/article-new/2014/09/iphone5c-header-800x658.jpg\" alt=\"iphone5c-header\" width=\"800\" height=\"658\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-386624\" /> <br />\nDavid Pogue, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/18/technology/personaltech/in-arrival-of-2-iphones-3-lessons.html\"><em>The New York Times</em></a><blockquote>The budget model, the new iPhone 5C, comes in five colors (&#36;100 for the 16-gigabyte model with a two-year contract, &#36;550 without). It\u2019s essentially identical to last year\u2019s iPhone 5, except that its back and sides are a single piece of plastic instead of metal and glass.Actually, \u201cplastic\u201d isn\u2019t quite fair. The 5C\u2019s case is polycarbonate, lacquered like a glossy piano. Better yet, its back edges are curved for the first time since the iPhones of 2008. You can tell by touch which way it\u2019s facing in your pocket.\r<br />\n<br />\nIt\u2019s a terrific phone. The price is right. It will sell like hot cakes; the new iPhones go on sale Friday. But just sheathing last year\u2019s phone in shiny plastic isn\u2019t a stunning advance.</blockquote>Jim Dalrymple, <a href=\"http://www.loopinsight.com/2014/09/17/review-iphone-5c-and-iphone-5s/\"><em>The Loop</em></a> <br />\n<blockquote>There is absolutely no give to this phone at all. It doesn\u2019t bend or buckle anywhere in the casing, which is what you want, obviously. It feels as solid as the 5s.\r<br />\n<br />\nThe iPhone 5c doesn\u2019t actually feel like plastic. It\u2019s strange when you first pick it up, but it almost feels like ceramic or a similar material that is glossy and hard. The manufacturing process that Apple used to make this phone and the metal reinforcement it used in the plastic casing certainly worked on making this phone tough.</blockquote>Darrell Etherington, <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2014/09/17/iphone-5c-review-apple/\"><em>TechCrunch</em></a><blockquote>To date, Apple\u2019s choice of materials has been one of its prime differentiating factors, at least from an aesthetics point of view, vs. the Android crop of competitors. So does dipping back into a polycarbonate shell threaten the image Apple has tried so hard to cultivate?\r<br />\n<br />\nThe answer is a resounding \u2018No.\u2019 Apple notes that the iPhone 5c is actually polycarbonate because it wanted to get the colors just right, and doing so in metal just wasn\u2019t feasible. Further, it points out that there\u2019s a steel frame (which doubles as an antenna) girding that polycarbonate shell, which results in a phone that feels sturdy in the hand, without the flex or perceived fragility of other plastic device designs.</blockquote><center><div id=\"os_dmp_embed\"></div></center> <br />\nLauren Goode, <a href=\"http://allthingsd.com/20140917/5c-comes-in-candy-colors-at-a-nice-price-for-newcomers-or-thrifty-upgraders\"><em>AllThingsD</em></a><blockquote>The iPhone 5C has the same A6 processor and the same 4-inch Retina display as the iPhone 5. Colors on the 5C\u2019s display look warmer.\r<br />\n<br />\nIt\u2019s just slightly thicker and heavier than the iPhone 5. And while the 5C isn\u2019t as refined-looking as the iPhone 5 or the new 5S, it isn\u2019t a tacky plastic phone, either. I\u2019ve tested plastic phones before, including the Samsung Galaxy S4 and the new Moto X from Motorola, and this phone feels more solid in the hand.</blockquote>Myriam Joire, <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2014/09/17/iphone-5c-review/\"><em>Engadget</em></a><blockquote>We\u2019re not going to lie. The iPhone 5c is gorgeous \u2014 we\u2019d even argue that it\u2019s the most beautiful iPhone since the 4 and 4s. It instantly makes the iPhone 5 and 5s look staid in comparison.\r<br />\n<br />\nSure, we prefer materials like aluminum and glass over plastic, and we appreciate the intricate craftsmanship that goes into building the iPhone 5 and 5s, but still, we can\u2019t help it \u2014 the 5c just triggers some reptilian part of our brains that screams, \u201cOMG, color!\u201d</blockquote><strong>Other reviews:</strong> <br />\n<br />\nAnand Shimpi, <a href=\"http://www.anandtech.com/show/7340/the-iphone-5c-review\"><em>AnandTech</em></a> <br />\nEdward Baig, <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/columnist/baig/2014/09/17/iphone-ios-7-review/2823545/\"><em>USA Today</em></a> <br />\nStuart Miles, <a href=\"http://www.pocket-lint.com/review/123702-apple-iphone-5c-review\"><em>Pocket-Lint</em></a> <br />\nLuke Peters, <a href=\"http://www.t3.com/reviews/iphone-5c-review\"><em>T3</em></a> <br />\nScott Stein, <a href=\"http://reviews.cnet.com/iphone-5c/\"><em>CNET</em></a> <br />\n<br />\nApple\u2019s iPhone 5c is currently <a href=\"http://store.apple.com/us/buy-iphone/iphone5c\">available for pre-order</a> and will begin shipping on September 20.<br /><br /><div class=\"linkback\">Related roundup: <a href=\"http://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-6/\">iPhone 6</a> </div>\n<div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n",

Remember Apple just announced a store trade-in program a couple weeks ago? I just look up some old device trade in value in Amazon. An Iphone 4 can fetch $140, an Samsung S2 can fetch about 60-130 depending on model. So someone with 2 years plan can walk in Apple, trade in one of these phone and get a new 5C.  Sure we can do it today with Amazon or many other sites out there, but you can't beat the convenience of an Apple store that can complete all the transaction at the same time including activating the phone in an attractive setting. <br />\n<br />\r\nEvery year there are more and more folks off subsidy and the truth is that not all of them know or care about the latest technology. For this group of consumer, brand, packaging, and design matter a lot  more than state of the art technology. The color bumper idea on 5C is brilliant for the teenager/early twenty group. Just look at all the people that is using the mid level phone now. They have the same choice of paying up and get the best phone but they want to save a few bucks and not go for a mid level phone instead. And Apple can target a certain subset of this customer and give them higher trade in price of their phone. With Apple's gross margin on the phone, if they overpay the trade-in phone by $50 but get an extra phone sale, Apple will still make out like a bandit. None of the other company including Samsung can duplicate this strategy.<br />\n<br />\r\nI think we should put 5C in the correct context. Last year Apple has 5, 4s and 4 as their phone line up. 4s sold about half as many units as 5. If 5C exceed 4s sales in the same cycle, 5c is a success. My view is that with the new color scheme, package as a new product, and Apple trade-in program, 5C will sell as well as 5s provide real growth in the Iphone line in term of unit, revenue and earning in the next few quarters.\r\n\n",

The 5c plaster shell does not feel like plaster at all. It feel like some kind of laminated steel. The shell is very rigid and has a very good feel when I hold it. <br />\n<br />\r\nBy definition once we get pass the few top end smartphones that was launch within the last few months, all other smartphones are developed with prior technologies. 5c target audience is the middle to high end user who want brand name product, distinctive design, good packaging, but not necessary the latest technology. Last year 4s sold about 1/2 as much as 5 in the same part of product cycle (so may be 12M unit in 4q12). There is definitely a market for &quot;not the latest technology&quot; smartphone. Apple just launch the in store trade-in program a couple week also. Someone can walk in Apple store, hand in their old Iphone 4 (trade in is about 140 in Amazon now), and walk out with a 5c and an itune gift card.  5c is really not for developing market like everyone thought. It is target for the vast majority of subsidized customers in the developed world whose next subsidy is available and they want a cheaper but good Iphone. The fact that 5c is branded as a new product this year (and look very different from other Iphone) will help a lot. Just look at clothing, handbag, shoes or any other consumer product categories. Brand design and packaging are as important as the technology behind the product once we get to mid market. I think 5C will do extremely well. The bar should be set against the current - 1 generation of Iphone that Apple carry every year. If 5c can outsell 4s of last year in the same part of the cycle, Apple would have a very successful product.\r\n\n",
