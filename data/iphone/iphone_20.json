Using his hands, Hilsenteger bends the iPhone 6 Plus as much as he can, with significant warping showing up near the device's volume buttons.\r<br />\n<br />\n<center><div id=\"video-wrapper\"><div id=\"video-container\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/znK652H6yQM?feature=player_detailpage\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div></div></center> <br />\nThe force placed on the iPhone 6 Plus in the video is unlikely to be replicated in a pocket, but as several photos have demonstrated <a href=\"http://www.macrumors.com/2014/09/23/iphone-6-plus-bending-pockets/\">in our earlier post</a>, it does not take much force to cause a slight curvature in the device. The iPhone 6 Plus does, however, remain functional after bending, but as noted by Hilsenger on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/UnboxTherapy/status/514519898488602624\">Twitter</a>, the device screen cracked when he attempted to bend it back into shape. \r<br />\n<br />\nBending issues are not limited to the iPhone 6 Plus, as previous generations of the iPhone, including the <a href=\"http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=1452478\">iPhone 5</a> and the <a href=\"http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=1754349\">iPhone 5s</a> have also seen complaints of bending after being subjected to a pocket.\r<br />\n<br />\nApple has not yet commented on the iPhone 6 Plus bending incidents, but iPhone 6 Plus owners can likely prevent bending by removing the phone from their pockets before sitting or bending, or by placing the device in a rigid protective case.\n                                        <div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n",

I think the big hoopla here is that the metal is *staying bent* instead of rebounding back to its former shape. Plastic would do that unless held in a particular position for a long period of time and/or exposed to heat.<br />\n<br />\r\nIs this a design flaw? Sure. But it's a flaw by design in the sense that people have placed unreasonable demands on Apple for bigger and thinner. Could you just imagine how the iPhone 6 would be perceived if it came out and was drastically thicker than competing phones? Apple just can't win.<br />\n<br />\r\nNow, I'm curious to see how Apple responds to this. Will this public revelation force them to create some magical solution to retain aluminum but give it some flex without the concern of staying bent? The challenge is now out there.\r\n\n",

The squared edges add strength to the form but without them, the strength is determined solely by the materials, in this case the aluminum and glass, which is pretty durable now. The only inside supports are from the metal rivets either attaching components to the housing or the padding around volume keys.<br />\n<br />\nHere's a photo from iFixit for those who want to see the points of weakness in the chassis:<br />\n<img src=\"https://d3nevzfk7ii3be.cloudfront.net/igi/MZkkrpauIeskXman.huge\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" /><br />\n<br />\nDesign oversight, maybe, but I don't think it's close to a antennagate.<br />\n<br />\nYou people and your large phones<img src=\"http://cdn.macrumors.com/vb/images/smilies/wink.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" title=\"Wink\" class=\"inlineimg\" />\n\n",

(Note: their tests clearly favor dropping and scratching and water resistance. They don't seem to worry about pockets being likely to cause great forces! Still, even with 10 seconds underwater taken into account, the iPhone 6/Plus beat &quot;waterproof&quot; Samsung devices.)<br />\n<br />\r\nI'm far more likely to drop my phone onto a hard surface or water than to put MASSIVE force on it with my leg against my pocket. Because that kind of mysterious force would leave my leg black and blue, and I'd learn my lesson!<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\r\nWait for a video of someone bending a Note 4 as hard as they can. See if it's still working, the way that iPhone 6 Plus is at the end! I'd rather have a slightly bent phone that still does everything, than a totally dead one.<br />\n<br />\r\nBetter yet, wait for statistical significance: testing MULTIPLE of each phone brand and averaging the results. Failing that, get the device that serves you best. A Note with an old-style poor fingerprint reader, which Samsung stops releasing software updates for in a year, and which has a full selection of malware but a poorer selection of apps, might be just the thing! It might not.</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</div>Same test. <br />\n<br />\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FwM4...oDvUnTzoqsYeNw\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FwM4...oDvUnTzoqsYeNw</a><br />\n<br />\r\nYou were saying &quot;?\r\n\n",

At one point in the video you can see him straining and his hands shaking while trying to bend it. His hands are shaking because of the obvious resistance he's received while trying to bend it. It is not easy to bend and will not bend without applying a great amount of force, much more force from putting into your front pants pocket under normal use. When I say normal use I mean the way everyone slips a phone into their pockets which is lengthway and not sideway. Most pants pockets cannot hold the iPhone 6 plus sideways so ask your self how did this really bend from left to right (horizontally) if it's lengthways in your front pants pocket! This guy who supposedly bend his phone in his front suit pants pocket while at a wedding or whatever I don't believe to be telling the whole truth, and just thinking about it more makes me find more holes in his story. Most dress pants pockets are also smaller than jeans pants pockets too. His story is pure BS I guarantee it.\r\n\n",

Older cars were not made to do this, and were less safe in an accident.  So, to sum up -- cars with &quot;crumple zones,&quot; and phones that can be carried in a front pocket without becoming deformed, are both examples of good engineering.\r\n\n",

Every single review (and I&rsquo;ve seen over 10) mention the camera bulge as a negative.   Granted even if you make the body flush with the camera you could still have this bending issue but that just proves that making the product as thin as possible was number one on the list.  When you make something so thin you limit what you can do with the internal structure. <br />\r\nApple serious needs to stop this &ldquo;let&rsquo;s make the product thin as possible&rdquo; non-sense.   I personally will be getting a mophie battery case for the 4.7&rdquo; so it should make it less susceptible to bending and greater battery life; both of both worlds.    Notice the word less because nothing is bend proof.\r\n\n",

I managed to drop it several times, and usually onto pavement.  I think it was weighted to land on its back, because the screen never broke when I dropped it.

I've sat with all my iPhones in my back pocket but in my car and office chairs which are soft. Who in their right mind puts their phone or something valuable in their back pocket and sit on something hard, then when it's damaged you complain?</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</div>It's not back pockets that are causing the problems according to some users, it's FRONT pockets (and obviously back pockets would as well).  At some point, people are going to pocket their phones.  I'm sitting here playing out scenarios in my mind....I'm a season pass holder at Disney World....walking around the parks I leave my phone in my pocket.  I'm not going to hold it in my hand while riding some of the rides (Space Mountain for example).  What am I supposed to do in those scenarios?  Wear giant pants on those days, or carry a man purse?  Front pocketing would be my first inclination, but if the phone is at risk of bending, that really is a problem in my book.  <br />\n<br />\r\nWe all know and knew that carrying a large phone like the 6 plus makes pocketing the phone more difficult, but it shouldn't physically damage the phone.\r\n\n",

I would never put my iPhone 5 in my back pocket screen out.<br />\n<br />\nEven then, the innards have very low compressive and shear strength, aren't bonded in any significant amount to either the aluminum &quot;tub&quot; or the screen which would improve shear strength like a core of a sandwich panel. Without support of the inner core, the back panel of the tub will buckle fairly easily and without some sort of bond on the screen edge to the tub edge, there won't be any way to carry any significant shear and compressive loads through the screen and tub edge. Lots of speculation on assembly on my part.<br />\n<br />\nIn some aspects the 5 series is in my opinion stronger due to a bit more material at the sidewalls in contact with the screen.<br />\n<br />\nOverall, I would rate the 4S as the best design from a structural standpoint, as a stainless steel frame is pretty robust in itself, and frankly shorter and thicker are an advantage.<br />\n<br />\nThat said, and knowing the complexity of the design constraints, the 6 / 6+ packs a lot of computing in a light and thin package, and that is what most of the market wants.<br />\n<br />\nAn easy way to strengthen the 6 would be to fill it will some sort of that resin that cures to a fair strength, glass bead or glass fiber filled epoxy would be suitable, but I'm not seeing that as a useful solution.\r\n\n",

Nobody was just sitting there going, &quot;man, i really want a gigantic phone, but I just wish it was thinner than the current iphone.&quot;  In fact, even before these phones were released, people thought it was silly to have the camera stick out of the phone.  It just doesn't make sense and totally takes a giant crap on an otherwise beautiful design.  It's like someone built a Ferrari, but there is a little lump on the hood to fit an engine that is just a little too big for the body.  Now we know that this phone's body is actually too weak to stay straight.<br />\n<br />\r\nI'm seriously thinking of cancelling my order for the plus.  At the very least, I will not buy from apple without getting an email stating that the phone bending under my pant pocket's pressure will not void my warranty.\r\n\n",

Would you rather get on a crappy 3 foot ladder or take your chances on a 6 foot crappy ladder?  <br />\r\nThis is why you&rsquo;re going to see a greater number of bent 5.5&rdquo; models vs 4.7&rdquo; models even if the 4.7&rdquo; outnumber the 5.5&rdquo; 2 to 1.  Both models will bend but because of the taller length of the 5.5&rdquo; it has more opportunity to do so in a similar sized pocket.   I don&rsquo;t think people realized the sacrifices you have to make with such a long device that&rsquo;s built from soft metal like aluminum.    Plus I expect many more 4.7&rdquo; users to rock a case because with a tall device like the 5.5&rdquo; it&rsquo;s going to make it even more unbearable and people will not enjoy it much.  I speak from experience because I owned a Note 2 and 3; case selection makes a huge difference.   I light duty case on this 5.5&rdquo; model won&rsquo;t stop it from bending .\r\n\n",

The phone has a weak point, which is right around the volume buttons and the sleep/wake button. It's a design flaw. There is no way around that fact. <br />\n<br />\nThe phone is so large that there are bound to be pressure points on its structure that the older smaller iPhones never had.

I don't believe he is really putting any effort behind it, and that piece seems clearly biased from the start.  I did however see the video of the guy bending the phone and I don't believe there were any special effects used other than his hands.  Although people don't purposely bend their phones like that, the device clearly seems weakly made. And I do think it can be a problem after repeated days/weeks/months of keeping it in your pocket.  A little bit of force adds up over time.  Even if it is a tiny bit at a time of keeping it in your pocket, the aluminum will get weaker and will bend more easily over time.  The bending video clearly shows the weakness is there for this to happen.  The CNN video does not disprove that in any way to me.\r\n\n",

Apple isn't responsible. Just look at the phone and exercise a little common sense! It is extremely thin, and the 6 Plus in particular has a huge difference between its thickness and its height. So any appreciable load on either end is going to have a considerable mechanical advantage and will likely produce bending. Anything this thin, and this large, will have less resistance to bending than something thicker/smaller. The fact that it's as durable as it is (I noticed that in the photos I've seen the screen is fine!) is testimony to how well constructed it is. Until we see a whole new breed of materials, people are going to have to accept that they can't have it both ways; thin and elegant, and strong enough to endure the majority of your body weight. <br />\n<br />\r\nIt's like thinking that a long distance runner can take on a wrestler. People are going to have to take some responsibility... Otherwise we're just slowly progressing toward a culture in which nobody is expected to be accountable for any damage they to do their possessions, their bodies, others, or anything for that matter. We will have to be completely regulated, 100% of the time, like infants... Is it a drag to realize you've damaged something you own, particularly something relatively valuable? Of course. Is it anybody else's fault. No.\r\n\n",
