  "htmltext": "\t\t\t\t\t\tBoth LG and Samsung plan to release phones that feature curved displays in the near future, reports <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/10/07/us-lg-curved-displays-idUSBRE99607720131007\"><em>Reuters</em></a>. Flexible curved displays, which have <a href=\"http://www.samsung.com/us/video/tvs/KN55S9CAFXZA\">been utilized</a> in television sets, are a developing technology for smartphones and other consumer electronic devices.<blockquote>Curved displays are in the early stages of development and allow bendable or foldable designs that could eventually allow mobile and wearable gadgets to take new forms that could radically change the high-end smartphone market.</blockquote>Apple has been rumored to be working on curved displays for several years, with <a href=\"http://www.macrumors.com/2011/05/23/apple-to-introduce-curved-glass-iphone-5/\">rumors</a> from 2011 suggesting the company could debut a <a href=\"http://www.macrumors.com/2011/09/26/apple-working-on-curved-glass-ios-devices-for-first-half-of-next-year/\">curved glass</a> iPhone. A patent for such a device was <a href=\"http://www.macrumors.com/2013/03/28/apple-researching-iphone-designs-with-flexible-wraparound-displays/\">published</a> in March of this year, depicting a phone with a wraparound body.\r<br />\n<br />\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-366828\" alt=\"corning_willow_glass\" src=\"http://cdn.macrumors.com/article-new/2013/02/corning_willow_glass.jpg\" width=\"540\" height=\"540\" /><center><em>Corning's Willow Glass</em></center> <br />\nMore recently, it has been suggested that the company's rumored iWatch could <a href=\"http://www.macrumors.com/2013/02/10/nyt-apple-is-working-on-a-curved-glass-smart-watch/\">incorporate</a> a curved glass display, using bendable Willow Glass. While Gorilla Glass has claimed that the technology is <a href=\"http://www.macrumors.com/2013/02/28/corning-says-devices-with-flexible-willow-glass-displays-unlikely-to-appear-for-at-least-three-years/\">not yet ready</a> for consumer devices, a plastic-based flexible display similar to the one used by LG and Samsung is readily available.\r<br />\n<br />\nThe debut of LG and Samsung's initial curved display products will provide a glimpse of what the future could hold for upcoming smartphones and other electronic devices, including the iWatch.\r<br />\n<br />\nLG's smartphone is said to utilize a 6-inch display that curves from top to bottom, while Samsung's will curve from side to side. Both displays are built on a plastic substrate that allows them to bend and flex, and according to LG, its display will be among the world's thinnest mobile panels.\r<br />\n<br />\nWhile the phones incorporate displays that bend, it is unclear whether the finished smartphones themselves will be flexible or rigid, similar to the impliable designs used in television sets from both companies.\r<br />\n<br />\nSamsung's smartphone will <a href=\"http://news.cnet.com/8301-1035_3-57604516-94/samsung-to-unveil-smartphone-with-curved-glass-in-october/\">launch</a> in October, while LG's will come slightly later, in November.

Think about it, part of your display (top half?) wraps around the phone so you can display time and weather or notifications on the back of your phone while you utilize the front display for other tasks.  You can use liquid metal to hold it all together as the frame.  Now dropping it, well that's another issue.  What about a &quot;flip phone&quot; where you can have large screens, but they neatly tuck away when not needed as you fold the phone.  When unfolded it creates a  unified large touch screen.\r\n\n",

But you apparently don't know about the first flat display, which was a Zenith CRT monitor. The benefits were immediately obvious.<br />\n<br />\nThe reason why old CRT's were convex, and by the way they weren't like a portion of a tube, that came later with some Sony displays, was because the electron beam spreads as it moves to the edge of the display. It turns into an eclipse. Until electronics were able to keep the beam shape round, they had to have the front of the screen shaped like a portion of a sphere, but flatter. Zenith was able to correct the beam distortion, and so could use a flat tube. Sony's screens, which came earlier than the zenith, used screens that were straight vertically, but still curved horizontally, because it was easier, as the beam had further to travel to the edge lengthwise than height wise.<br />\n<br />\nNow, as for your concave idea, well, it's terrible. A concave surface will collect glare from every angle. It will be far worse.<br />\n<br />\nAnd so there you have it.<font color=\"#808080\"><br />\n<br />\n----------<br />\n<br />\n</font><div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:5px; \">\n<div class=\"smallfont\" style=\"margin-bottom:2px\">Quote:</div>\n<table cellpadding=\"6\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\" width=\"100%\">\n<tr>\n<td class=\"alt2\" style=\"border:1px inset\">\n<div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tOriginally Posted by <strong>ywshang</strong>\n<a href=\"showthread.php?p=18097531#post18097531\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img class=\"inlineimg\" src=\"http://cdn.macrumors.com/vb/images/buttons/viewpost.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"View Post\" /></a>\n</div>\n<div style=\"font-style:italic\">That was because the older CRT monitors all had a CONVEX surface, which indeed increased glare. Relative to a convex surface, a flat screen reduces glare. But the OP said if the surface could be made just slightly concave, it surely would further reduce the glare, which is very true physic that you totally missed.</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</div>No. Making the screen concave will increase glare significantly. If you ever get hold of a magnifying mirror, used for makeup, you will see that it collects light. It's shaped like a telescope mirror. You really don't want a screen shaped like that.<br />\n<br />\r\nI only minored in physics and had just one year of optics, so I suppose I could be wrong, but I highly doubt it.\r\n\n",
