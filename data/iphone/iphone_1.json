  "htmltext": "\t\t\t\t\t\tApple has commented on the ongoing complaints about the iPhone 6 Plus bending in user pockets, telling <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CNBCtech/status/515198657180991488\">CNBC</a> that the new iPhones include steel/titanium inserts to reinforce stress locations and that they use the \"strongest glass in the industry.\"\r<br />\n<br />\nThe company <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CNBCtech/status/515199059112775680\">went on to say</a> that only nine customers had complained about bent iPhones, suggesting the issue is not as widespread as it has appeared in the media. It also <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/intl/fastft?post=211822\">stated</a> that both the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus have met or exceeded testing for strength and durability, and that <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/articles/apple-defends-against-complaints-of-bending-iphones-1411668618\">bending</a> in the iPhone 6 Plus during normal use is \"extremely rare.\"\r<br />\n<br />\n<img src=\"http://cdn.macrumors.com/article-new/2014/09/bent_iphone_6_plus.jpg\" alt=\"bent_iphone_6_plus\" width=\"704\" height=\"295\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-423400\" /><blockquote>Our iPhones are designed, engineered and manufactured to be both beautiful and sturdy. iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus feature a precision engineered unibody enclosure constructed from machining a custom grade of 6000 series anodized aluminum, which is tempered for extra strength. They also feature stainless steel and titanium inserts to reinforce high stress locations and use the strongest glass in the smartphone industry. We chose these high-quality materials and construction very carefully for their strength and durability. We also perform rigorous tests throughout the entire development cycle including 3-point bending, pressure point cycling, sit, torsion, and user studies. iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus meet or exceed all of our high quality standards to endure everyday, real life use.\r<br />\n<br />\nWith normal use a bend in iPhone is extremely rare and through our first six days of sale, a total of nine customers have contacted Apple with a bent iPhone 6 Plus. As with any Apple product, if you have questions please contact Apple.</blockquote>Reports of the iPhone 6 Plus's weakness to bending first began trickling in on Monday, after several <em>MacRumors</em> <a href=\"http://www.macrumors.com/2014/09/23/iphone-6-plus-bending-pockets/\">forum members</a> shared images of devices that had bent while in a pocket. The bending issue went viral after a YouTuber <a href=\"http://www.macrumors.com/2014/09/23/iphone-6-plus-bending-pockets/\">posted a video</a> of the iPhone 6 Plus warping out of shape when bent in his hands, which caused significant damage near the device's volume buttons.\r<br />\n<br />\nGiven the media attention the bending received, it was difficult to tell how many users were truly affected by iPhone 6 Plus bending during real world usage. Though Apple kept quiet on the issue until today, the company has been directing its support staff to replace affected phones under warranty following a visual inspection.<br /><br /><div class=\"linkback\">Related roundup: <a href=\"http://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-6/\">iPhone 6</a> </div>\n<div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n",

There is this thing of expecting absolute perfection from Apple products (to be fair, they <i>are</i> expensive so one can expect a bit of perfectionism) so it's only really Apple users who have held the things at every angle looking for contrast problems (remember the original iPod Touch?) and other issues that they'd probably not have spotted if they weren't deliberately looking for problems.<br />\n<br />\nCreaking.  That's another one that people look for with Apple stuff.  The faintest little sound from it and off it goes to the genius bar.

Like any other company, Apple drags its feet in acknowledging a problem exists.... It's only after customers are persistent that they'll acknowledge a problem. <br />\n<br />\r\nThe greater the cost to the company to correct an issue the greater they will deny that the problem exists.  If the issue of the 6+ bending is due to poor design, it is going to be very costly to correct and Apple will fight vehemently against admitting it.<br />\n<br />\r\nThe GPU issue with Early-2011 Macbook Pros is just one of those examples.\r\n\n",

As far as numbers go, there have already been over 10 million sold, which are not all 6+ and not all already in the hands of their owners.  However, if even a few hundred out of the likely few million 6+'s already being used have had issues and even if hundreds more have issues, we are still only talking about a possible defect that is having an impact on under half a percent of the likely number of 6+'s sold.

(Assuming only 3 million 6+'s out there it would take 30,000 reports to even equal 1% defective.) It would be much more widespread already if this were a huge problem.

The iPhone 4/4S design was &quot;robust&quot; and relatively scratch-resistant, but people complained it was heavy and the back glass could shatter. They removed the back glass from the iPhone 5/5S and people complained that it scuffed. They removed the chamfered edges from the 6/6Plus, made it thinner to keep the weight increase to a minimum, and people complain that it can bend under excessive force. <br />\n<br />\r\nSamsung uses plastic, which is lighter, and flexible without being as malleable as aluminum. It will break before it becomes permanently bent. Apple tried selling a plastic phone last year. It was panned as being &quot;cheap feeling&quot; and didn't sell as well as Apple expected. There aren't many more design choices they could have made. Sure, they could have used thicker aluminum or more reinforcements inside, but then it would have been bigger and/or heavier, and perhaps more prone to shattering glass from drops. SquareTrade just rated the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus as two of the most durable phones they have ever tested.<br />\n<br />\r\nComplain about real issues, such as Apple releasing a software update that killed cellular capabilities. &quot;Bendghazi&quot; is just hype.\r\n\n",

This is like Microsoft calling the RROD rare for Xbox 360 after a few dozen complaints in the first week.<br />\n<br />\r\nI agree that people can do more to protect their phone from bending, but I mean come on.  Apple is spending billions on sapphire research to improve the durability of their display screens.  They want Unbreakable and Unscratchable to become synonymous with Apple devices.  But that is all moot if your phone is going to bend after having only one &quot;aw ****&quot; moment.<br />\n<br />\r\nI think we may have hit the thinnest a phone can be for a while.  Apple may have made a mistake trying to be the thinnest phone out there.  Even if they were 1 mm thicker, they could have both avoided the protruding camera issue AND perhaps a thicker metal back might have avoided #bendgate.  Being 8mm is pretty great for a phone these days.<br />\n<br />\r\nAnd where is Apple's quality assurance in all this?  I mean did they do no stress analysis or consider real world usage scenarios?  Or were they just so proud and quick to get iPhone 6 Plus out the door they dropped the ball on testing the case design properly??? <br />\n<br />\r\nPerhaps Apple can learn a thing or two from how Ikea puts their ****** furniture through aggressive quality testing...\r\n\n",

Most people would never notice, and I don't intend to look for it when I get mine! But it might be true. Look at products around you from ANY company, lay them on different sides, and you'll discover slight non-flatness or unevenness is practically the rule, not the exception. It's just that we pay attention sometimes (media storm!) and not others.<br />\n<br />\nI'm not saying any iPhones (or any significsnt number) are &quot;pre-warped,&quot; but some past Apple products have shown that (PowerBook G4) even if it never got much attention. So I wonder about the possibility.<br />\n<br />\nWonder--but not worry: the BACK of the phone will always wobble on a desk without a case (not that I have ever used a phone that wat) and I will NEVER use my phone face down. (Who would?) There is literally no circumstance in which I would notice a slight curve (not damage/bend) EXCEPT when a blog post makes me look for one <img src=\"http://cdn.macrumors.com/vb/images/smilies/tongue.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" title=\"Stick Out Tongue\" class=\"inlineimg\" /> So I will not look.

But I'm with you: the simplest explanation is:<br />\n<br />\n- A bend, even your own fault, is frustrating in a new expensive purchase. A mystery bend? Even more so! Motivation to post/complain.<br />\n<br />\n- Anti-Apple trolls (most unpaid) are common. ALL trolls are common on the Internet.<br />\n<br />\n- Apple &quot;sheeple&quot; are actually the most critical of Apple of anyone! They hold Apple to a higher standard, and will pitch a fit easily. (I know I'll tolerate all kinds of bends and cracks and creaks and cheapness in my Dell display and Logitech keyboard that I would be very bugged by in an Apple product. They've set expectations by giving me better!)<br />\n<br />\n- The Apple name sells ads for so-called &quot;journalists.&quot; It's also a way to write an article without doing work. Research? Facts? So old-fashioned. Seriously, even the BBC News has been riding the &quot;bend&quot; story for days, without bothering to dig for whether it's even a story!<br />\n<br />\nThat all adds up to fictions and non-issues becoming &quot;gates&quot;... with no need for Samsung or anyone to spend a dime.\r\n\n",

If you can't do those things then there <i>is</i> no problem, and nobody here has any reason to believe a word you say with your brand new account. This isn't paranoia, Samsung has been caught redhanded paying people to trash their competitors on websites in the past, and there's a lot of new accounts trashing Apple here over something with no evidence it's a widespread problem.<br />\n<br />\r\nYou're so upset that people are treating you &quot;poorly&quot; by demanding evidence for your unlikely claims, but whose fault is that really? All that will go away if you offer a sliver of proof. It's in your best interests to provide that proof if you truly wish Apple to fix this alleged problem, and it would stop people from accusing you of being yet another plant by one of Apple's competitors trying to turn this into a bigger story than it deserves.</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</div>What indication have I given that I'm upset or personally offended? I am, however, disappointed that I can't simply discuss this issue like an adult--and that this is honestly what anonymity does to people. I don't really care whether or not people on this forum believe me, hence reason number one I haven't posted any pictures here. Not to mention, a response of &quot;Oh, that sucks! Any chance you could post some pictures so we can check it out?&quot; would get you a lot further than &quot;YOU WORK FOR SAMSUNG PICS OR GET OUT,&quot; and then there's the instant classic, &quot;You put your phone in your pocket? What did you expect?&quot;<br />\n<br />\r\nOn top of that, the only other camera I own is the front-facing camera on my MacBook, which is far from ideal for taking detailed pictures of a subtle warping in a glossy black device. I was considering using my girlfriend's iPad later and seeing how it took, but I'm probably not going to bother. As I've stated a few times, it's not even a hugely noticeable bend, and certainly nothing like most of the pictures going around right now. If you lie it flat on the screen side without a case, the top right corner (top left looking at the front of the phone) is raised just a touch, so that it wobbles when you tap that corner. If you hold it up and look along the side profile, you can still see a very small bit of the screen on that corner where it's bending down just a bit.<br />\n<br />\r\nLike I said, nothing worth freaking out over. My only personal concern is whether it's indicative of future issues, which is why I'm looking for other people with the same issue and trying to offer my experience so far with this one.\r\n\n",

Those who are still harping, we're talking numbers that are so small as to be barely worth worrying about here.  Let's say it's not 9 who experienced it, but that only 10% of those who experienced the problem called Apple.  That puts 90 users in the first 6 days, so for ease of numbers, let's call it 100 people in a week.  That's 100 people out of 10-15 million (it was 10 million the first weekend, but I'm sure we're approaching 20 million sold now.) <br />\n<br />\nNow, let's assume of that initial 15 million batch, that 100 MORE per week will bend their phones.  Over the two year typical ownership cycle, that means that 10,400 people will bend their phones through normal use.  Wow! you think, over ten THOUSAND bent phones.   Except that 10,400 bent phones out of 15 million is 0.0693%.  So out of the initial batch, at 10x the reported failure rate from Apple, less than 7 hundredths of one percent of users will experience a bent phone in the full two years.  That's one out of every 1500 users, over the course of the phone's lifetime.  That's a VERY rare incidence of failure for a consumer electronic device.  Even if we multiply that by 3 to account for maybe 1/3 of orders being for the plus with all failures being on the plus, we're still only talking 2/10 of one percent (0.2%)failure over the lifetime of the phone.  <br />\n<br />\nConsider that probably 5-10% of users will shatter their screens during the same timeframe through drops and such...a failure rate 72 to 140 times that of the 'bending' issue.  (IOW, you are two orders of magnitude more likely to shatter your screen than to bend your phone through normal use).<br />\n<br />\nIf you take Apple at their word, and assume that all bent phones have been reported (unlikely, but probably closer to reality than a 10x increase), we're talking a failure rate of 6 thousandths of one percent.

The costs of over engineering would be past onto the consumer.<br />\n<br />\r\n A laptop would also have to withstand damage from backpack and brief cases.

If I had no case I would be extra careful siting down with it. If I had an iPhone 6 Plus I would never even try it. Not that others are wrong or should not have to make sacrifices, I just could not do it. Call it OCD if you want.  WITH THAT BEING SAID. I do also believe apple should have made the 6 Plus stronger and more resistant to bending. I think aluminium unibody design is not acceptable. At the very least they should have put in more internal bracing. <br />\n<br />\r\nApple did not recommend users not to put the iPhone in their pockets. If the phone should not be put in pockets apple should have used the opportunity today to say that. Apple has their reasons why they did not, but I'm sure their are some people at apple saying maybe we should have put in a little more effort in the design.\r\n\n",

Moved On/Off button from top to side, opposite volume buttons.  Not only did this line up two week points, a no-no in structural rigidity, it makes it difficult to turn off/on without accidentally adjust volume and vice versa.<br />\n<br />\r\n2. Volume buttons turned into ovoid bars instead of round buttons.  These ovoid bars are twice as long as the old round buttons.  They end up creating a very week side of the phone.  Long ovoid voids in metal are very week.  Round holes in metal, as long as they aren't too large, do very little to impact the strength.  <br />\n<br />\r\n3. Volume buttons now directly opposite SIM slot.  So now you have 5 long ovoid voids in the structure (mute, volume x2, on/off, sim) all opposite each other.  Very bad design.<br />\n<br />\r\n4. Made phone too thin.  Every millimeter counts in rigidity.  An extra millimeter or two would have increased the strength of the phone a very large amount.<br />\n<br />\r\nWhy Apple did this?<br />\n<br />\r\nThey claim that the on/off was too hard to reach 1 handed if left on top.  Not sure about the +, but on my 6 I can reach the top of my phone with my first finger rather than thumb to sleep it.  No need to reach it to turn it on as you don't press that button to do that.<br />\n<br />\r\nVolume buttons changed for purely aesthetic reasons.  Was it worth it?  Hardly.<br />\n<br />\r\nThinness is because Ive is obsessed with it even if no customers are asking for it.  We asked for better batteries.  In the 6, 1 mm would have allowed for 1 mm more of actual battery guts, and at least a 25% capacity increase.  My 6 doesn't have enough battery.  It's about what the 5 was, and considering it's bigger, it makes no sense.<br />\n<br />\r\nHow Apple can fix it in this iteration:<br />\n<br />\r\nResize the buttons in question to be much smaller with round holes.  Round holes are much stronger.  They can still line up with the case buttons, though the buttons now won't be backed by a full sized button underneath.<br />\n<br />\r\nWhat they can do with the next version:<br />\n<br />\r\nMove the on/off button, decrease the size of the volume buttons.<br />\n<br />\r\nMake the phone 1mm thicker, and advertise how much better the battery is.\r\n\n",

That's why we always have to pay attention to what they actually said and didn't say.  <br />\n<br />\nApple said, &quot;<i>through our first six days of sale, a total of nine customers have contacted Apple with a bent iPhone 6 Plus.</i>&quot;<br />\n<br />\n- What does customer &quot;contact&quot; mean?

Do they count?<br />\n<br />\n- More importantly, since normally only about 1/6 of iPhones are sold through Apple, what about people who instead went back to the retailer or carrier that they bought it from?  We've already heard from people who returned theirs like that right away, without contacting Apple.   That alone should bump it up to over 50 people, if the ratio holds.<br />\n<br />\n- Apple also only mentioned the 6+.  What about the iPhone 6?  Any complaints there?  <br />\n<br />\n- What about now, more than six days later?  It's not unusual for people to think something is totally their own fault, but make contact later once the news hits that there might be a design flaw.  I very much doubt it's still only nine.<br />\n<br />\nIs bending widespread?  I don't think so.  I think a lot of it is that people are not used to large thin phones.   But is Apple being totally transparent?  Of course not.   Apple always quotes the lowest number it thinks it can get away with, before being questioned by anyone paying close attention, and they don't hold press conferences where reporters can ask deeper questions.\r\n\n",
