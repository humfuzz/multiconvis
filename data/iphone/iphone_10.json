Unsurprisingly, the iPhone 5c's dismantling has revealed numerous similarities with the iPhone 5, including nearly identical innards with matching A6 processors.\r<br />\n<br />\nWhile the internals and form factor are largely the same, the iPhone 5c is slightly thicker and heavier than the iPhone 5 and due to its polycarbonate shell. The 5c also has a larger battery, measuring in at 1510 mAh compared to the 1440 mAh battery of the iPhone 5, and it shares camera parts with the iPhone 5s, though the latter has a larger aperture. iFixit found that the plastic shell was nearly impossible to bend, largely because of its heft â€” the rear case weighs in at 43.8 grams.\r<br />\n<br />\n<center><div id=\"video-wrapper\"><div id=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/4E55-y7s7Ek?feature=player_detailpage\" height=\"360\" width=\"640\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></div></div></center><blockquote>We may not have super strength, but we put this case to the muscle test, anyway. The results: this lacquered plastic is as strong and blue as Captain Planet.\r<br />\n<br />\nIt's good to know that, though the rear panel is made with plastic to presumably cut costs, Apple did not compromise build quality in the process.</blockquote>iFixit gave the iPhone 5c a 6 out of 10 repairability score, one point lower than the iPhone 5 and the same score given to the iPhone 5s, due to the lack of the pull tab on the battery, the proprietary screws, and the considerable amount of adhesive used to hold the phone together. iFixit has a number of other pictures and a detailed rundown of the iPhone 5c dismantling process <a href=\"http://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/iPhone+5c+Teardown/17382/\">on its website</a>.\n                                        <div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n",
