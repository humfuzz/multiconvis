But it could have been Antofagasta, Chile or \u00c7a\u011f\u0131\u015f Buca\u011f\u0131, Turkey or Uelzen, Germany or Missinipi, Saskatchewan.<br/><br/>I live in BC and raised my family there for most of their lives. But for the past 12 years of nearly a 45 year career in mining and mineral exploration, I have seen no meaningful work in the industry in BC. Thus, the millions of dollars that my Canadian client companies raise, to some degree from Canadian investors, has been spent in foreign countries.<br/><br/>A good part of the reason for so little work in the province is the uncertainty, delays, restrictions in and of permitting for mineral exploration. And without exploration, the mines that follow, along with the tax base, the bursaries, the scholarships, the summer jobs, the apprenticeships and industrial training and straight out high wages paid in a hinterland with few alternatives, is lost.<br/><br/>These issues are mentioned in the discussion paper, just as they have been mentioned in previous government studies for as long as I can remember as the industry slowly evaporated.<br/><br/>But ultimately, the real reason for the erosion of the industry in BC is the uncertainty or, more realistically, the inability to put a discovery into production. The investment in the sector has migrated to Google, Disney, Tesla and other fashionable alternatives largely because of an atmosphere of an over zealous regulatory regime that includes rabid environmental protection legislation. <br/><br/>Further,  and at the risk of being labelled and discounted as a non-progressive politically backward social Luddite or simply as a bigot, an imposed over emphasis on native involvement in the industry and a perception by the investment community that the BC indigenous community is against resource development.<br/><br/>For decades, exploration relied on local 1st  nations for help in exploration camps. It was an informal arrangement where we would hire locals based on opportunity, experience and performance. As the years progressed, this evolved to a dictate by law and the relationship became an expected requirement, or, if I am allowed here in 2018 to be so politically and culturally insensitive, an entitlement expected of the companies. Job performance has become irrelevant and local first nations involvement has become largely a simple legal obligation.<br/><br/>In reading through the Discussion Paper, this is not a \u201crevitalization\u201d except as applied from the thesaurus of a government bureaucrat assigned to the project. It is simply a politically fashionable exercise of a government&#39;s intent to address their perception that the public has that indigenous issues are ignored by the resource industry.<br/><br/>That perception is far from being the truth.<br/><br/>The process for decades has been heavily weighted on indigenous involvement in all mineral exploration projects in BC. But over the years, this cooperative arrangement has been increasingly cemented by regulation and formal process. This discussion paper to me reads as a re-manufacturing and relabelling and an formal imposition of what as been a more cooperative effort.<br/><br/>But  the process appears heavily weighted against the resources industries. The component makeup of the EAO is unknown. But given the current flavour of the ecologically righteous, the biases that can be imposed based on political influence is a huge elephant sitting on the shoulders of the committee.<br/><br/>Given the results of past decisions on major resource issues (Tatsenshini, Muskwa-Ketchika, Taseko Resources and of course, recent denial of the need for a pipeline), the decisions have not favoured resource development.<br/><br/>Thirdly, requiring input from \u201cthe public\u201d simply means that the organized machinery that has the means, mandate and backing, can and will continue to participate as \u201cthe public\u201d feedback. The true general public has become so far removed from the reality and environmental cost of their lifestyles along with the corresponding media misinterpretation of resource issues in the province that this true public has a far too tainted (and ignorant) outlook on the resource industry to provide valid input.<br/><br/>So now we rely on our resource professionals to go to other countries to extract and bring back the resources we all, including the indigenous population, demand for our contemporary lifestyles, all the while we admire our untouched landscapes and wax poetic about traditional lifestyles. We don&#39;t take ownership of our own environmentally destructive consumer lifestyles and simply offload it to other countries.<br/><br/>This \u201crevitalization\u201d will simply be a new bureaucratic process of an older practice that other countries don&#39;t have. It is yet another reason the resource industry has walk away from the province.",
