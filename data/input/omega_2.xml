<sentencetext>2 These new regs will kill the vast majority of new projects. They are too onerous on project proponents. They give organizations that oppose projects too much power to kill them. Project proponents will develop projects in other jurisdictions. Investment in developing natural resources in B.C. will continue to fall. Those kind of projects will still get developed. Often in jurisdictions with weak environmental protection regs. They will simply not get built in B.C. which already has stronger environmental protection regs. BC loses economically. The world loses environmentally. 
The latest evidence of investment flight is captured in the following quotes from Business in Vancouver article of June 19, 2018: https://biv.com/article/2018/06/oil-and-gas-sector-sounds-alarm-over-flight-capital. " Since the election of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau three years ago, and since the BC NDP government came to power in B.C. about a year ago, the energy industry has been voting with its feet. The biggest beneficiary has been the U.S., where capital spending in oil and gas increased 38% ($120 billion) in 2017, according to the CAPP. Spending in Canadas oil and gas sector, meanwhile, declined 56% over three years, from $81 billion in 2014 to $45 billion in 2017, according to CAPP.  In the last three years alone, $89 billion worth of pipeline and liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects were cancelled or abandoned. " The full article is attached.

<sentencetext>4 Environment and Climate Change Minister George Heyman:
I am writing today with regard to the Environmental Assessment Revitalization Discussion Paper.
As a British Columbian, I am deeply concerned about the cumulative effect of government policies and regulatory reviews are having on our energy sector and jobs in our province. The fact is, Canada is falling behind in the global race to attract oil and natural gas investment.
I believe we need fair rules to protect health, safety and the environment  but not rules that create undue costs, delay and overlap  or only apply to Canadian energy but not to foreign energy.
A predictable and clearly-defined regulatory environment is important in order to enhance investor confidence in Canadas oil and natural gas industry. Timely approval is an important benchmark needed to attract investment and promote reconciliation through economic development.
Further, establishing a predictable regulatory framework will be important to future liquefied natural gas projects required to undergo an environmental assessment.
Any changes to the existing environmental assessment review process must not result in unnecessary additional costs and be mindful of those costs already associated with doing business in Canada.
Thanks for your attention to this matter.

<sentencetext>6 Please stop trying to hog-tie energy development through quasi-political attempts to delay our economic benefits from oil. We are committed to oil for the next 50+ years, and can provide the most environmentally sound extraction in the world.  By encumbering the process, you are robbing Canadians of necessary, well=paying jobs, and, at the same time enabling those countries with little or no environmental conscience to profit from our need to purchase their "blood-oil".

<sentencetext>17 I am concerned about the decisions being made that will harm our economic viability.  We need to consider that we are behind the world in producing our own supply of gas & oil and from what I have witnessed in the past 40 years is that decisions made are reflecting the views of a few southerners. Our infrastructure across Canada can not handle a change to total electric (ie cars). We shoul ensure our products are available on the world market at market at market prices. Instead of focusing on killing our industry focus on how to safely prevent accidents (ie dual sleeve pipes for pipelines where a sensor indicates a leak & it can be repaired before the outer pipe breaks). I am ashamed of our whole government. They forget where the money comes from but, they have always made our northern gas & oil jobs suffer because of a small bunch of people  (in BC it happens to be the small corner of the mainland). As Well, we have refinery capabilities which would create jobs if governments had not shut them down. I am not an activist but a senior living in Northern BC who is tired of the blinders everyone has on. Start looking beyond the disagreements & focus on what is good for the WHOLE country. Common sense has been lost to activition.

<sentencetext>20 It's time to build the Trans Mountain Pipeline.  It will enable 40 plus native bands to enter the mainstream economy, reduce emissions in countries we export to, improve the standard of living for poorer nations as well as Canadians and much more.  I have total confidence in Vancouver's Harbourmaster and this is an under two per cent increase in tanker traffic.  The majority of British Columbians and Canadians want it so let's get on with it.  The energy sector is essential to our confederation and stability as a country. Without it we will be decreasing funds for education, healthcare and all the many privileges that have come from the development of the energy sector in the 1950s and that Canadians (especially young Canadians) now expect as a right instead of a privilege.  I'm appalled at the stalling on this portfolio as it is shortsighted in the short term and deadly in the long term to neglect both public opinion and the public purse.

<sentencetext>27 I was directly involved in the regulatory process for pipeline on several occasions. It is currently extensive, expensive and used mainly by dogmatic parties to delay projects rather than to protect the environment.
Al parties including the petroleum companies want a thorough, reasonable assessment with practical conditions produced in a timely fashion. The process has already been politicized and certainly does not need any more bureaucratic layers. Leaving natural resources unused is an economic death spiral that is already affecting our quality of life. Let us stop fooling around and move forward into the future with confidence that we can effectively manage future changes together.

<sentencetext>37 Letter:
Environment and Climate Change Minister George Heyman:
I am writing today with regard to the Environmental Assessment Revitalization Discussion Paper.
As a British Columbian, I am deeply concerned about the cumulative effect of government policies and regulatory reviews are having on our energy sector and jobs in our province. The fact is, Canada is falling behind in the global race to attract oil and natural gas investment.
I believe we need fair rules to protect health, safety and the environment  but not rules that create undue costs, delay and overlap  or only apply to Canadian energy but not to foreign energy.
A predictable and clearly-defined regulatory environment is important in order to enhance investor confidence in Canadas oil and natural gas industry. Timely approval is an important benchmark needed to attract investment and promote reconciliation through economic development.
Further, establishing a predictable regulatory framework will be important to future liquefied natural gas projects required to undergo an environmental assessment.
Any changes to the existing environmental assessment review process must not result in unnecessary additional costs and be mindful of those costs already associated with doing business in Canada.
Thanks for your attention to this matter.

<sentencetext>40 It's time we stopped deferring and studying energy projects and get  them built. We need site C, we need the pipeline expansion, we need  the present government to stop being anti business and anti energy projects. The NDP's inability to make decisions is costing us a healthy future. Continually over studying and assessing projects in favour of political posturing clearly makes us look like a closed socialist state. We are looking like fools to the world. At the same time the government supports the dirty salmon farming industry and is trying to sidestep the issue by putting it in the hands of native  leaders . Cowardly politics .

<sentencetext>41 This is a ridiculous argument. Everyone is concerned for the environment, but making a living is what we all strive for. I cant think of one aspect of our lives that isnt affected by petroleum. Not all of us sit around smoking dope all day. But then again most lighters use petroleum.

<sentencetext>43 Our country has a very important resource, Oil. And yes we need to reduce this resource as we know it is effecting our environment. However we just can not shut the tap off today or not even tomorrow. The government receives a tax base from all industries involved in the Oil Industry. Maybe we need to increase the tax even higher for the purpose of more investments into future energy ideas, more research on ways to reduce the use of hydrocarbon resources. More incentives for electric car buyers. Look into larger loads of commodities by trucking companies with less trucks on the road. Instead of single trailers, increase to two or three trailer trains, on more allowable highways. 
The BC Government has been trying to hold up the Kinder Morgan Pipe Line. This must go through. Its is for the benefit of all Canadians. The Tax base received on a project like this will help the government in resources to research the above suggestions.
I am in favor of Hydrocarbon Reduction, but we cannot do it with out more alternatives for our Canadian Life styles, which Canadians will not compromise.
We still need oil and the government needs that income. We just need to find ways to reduce our use.

<sentencetext>54 Responsible environmental assessment law must:
* Ensure independent evidence and oversight of assessments
* Provide more meaningful public participation and participant funding to eliminate corporate bias
* Address cumulative effects within a region, through more project assessments and mandatory regional assessments
* Ensure projects that dont meet important legal criteria  including a climate test and Indigenous consent  are rejected
I cite the work of West Coast Environmental Law as a responsible start and would like to see us develop a framework built on this foundation.

I believe we need fair rules to protect health, safety and the environment  but not rules that create undue costs, delay and overlap  or only apply to Canadian energy but not to foreign energy.
A predictable and clearly-defined regulatory environment is important in order to enhance investor confidence in Canadas oil and natural gas industry. Timely approval is an important benchmark needed to attract investment and promote reconciliation through economic development.
Further, establishing a predictable regulatory framework will be important to future liquefied natural gas projects required to undergo an environmental assessment.
Any changes to the existing environmental assessment review process must not result in unnecessary additional costs and be mindful of those costs already associated with doing business in Canada.
Thanks for your attention to this matter.

<sentencetext>58 I would like a fair environmental review process that protects health, safety and the environment, but ensures new rules dont create undue costs and delays  or only apply to Canadian energy but not to foreign energy.
Establishing a predictable regulatory framework will be important to future liquefied natural gas projects required to undergo an environmental assessment. We need to make sure that Canada stays open for business.

<sentencetext>71 Lots of positive changes. I particularly like the addition of the law's purposes, legislated decision criteria (though the devil will be in the details), assessment of both positive and negative effects, centralized and accessible data, and what appears to be a strengthened monitoring system post-approval. 
My concerns are the following. First I didn't see anything about ensuring that the scope of assessments ensure quality instead of quantity. Second, I didn't see anything to help address the Black Box nature of significance determinations. Third, it appears that there is nothing to address the poor economic benefit information gathered in environmental assessment, which inevitably influences justification decisions. And lastly I see repeated emphasis on both scientific and Indigenous knowledge, which is fine, but there is also local knowledge and perhaps other knowledges. I would suggest this notion of appropriate knowledge be broadened. 
Thank you

<sentencetext>73 Please consider making policies that do not hinder companies with undue costs and delays but still keep the environment and public safety in mind.Many jobs are in the energy and oil and gas sector and more will be created if we welcome investment in this area.So far many companies have been burdened with issues that stopped progress all together, example being Petronas.

<sentencetext>74 Environment and Climate Change Minister George Heyman:
I am writing today with regard to the Environmental Assessment Revitalization Discussion Paper.
As a British Columbian, I am deeply concerned about the cumulative effect of government policies and regulatory reviews are having on our energy sector and jobs in our province. The fact is, Canada is falling behind in the global race to attract oil and natural gas investment.
I believe we need fair rules to protect health, safety and the environment  but not rules that create undue costs, delay and overlap  or only apply to Canadian energy but not to foreign energy.
A predictable and clearly-defined regulatory environment is important in order to enhance investor confidence in Canadas oil and natural gas industry. Timely approval is an important benchmark needed to attract investment and promote reconciliation through economic development.
Further, establishing a predictable regulatory framework will be important to future liquefied natural gas projects required to undergo an environmental assessment.
Any changes to the existing environmental assessment review process must not result in unnecessary additional costs and be mindful of those costs already associated with doing business in Canada.
Thanks for your attention to this matter.

<sentencetext>76 I am concerned and watchful because I wish to ensure only the establishment of a predictable regulatory framework is important to future liquefied natural gas projects during an environmental assessment. We need to make sure that Canada stays open for business.
Unnecessary additional costs are not acceptable and must be mindful of our ability to do business in Canada.

<sentencetext>85 I am 100% in favour of the Trans Mountain Pipeline. I wish you would start listening to the silent majority. This is the first letter I have written and I have been for it since day 1. I didn't necessarily want to pay for it as a taxpayer, but I will just to make sure Canada looks like it's open for business. The business world is looking at us as having absolutely no business sense, and I can't blame them. Let's gain a little respect with people who invest in our own and other Countries.  I'm sorry but I have absolutely no respect for paid protestors, but believe them if you will.  We all know what's going on but Gov't seems to be scared of them. As a senior who still works, I'm rather ashamed that I voted for Justin Trudeau. PLEASE FIX IT !

<sentencetext>86 Protecting nature, species and ecosystems is primary over all, most first nations people would agree with that.  But we need 1st Nations approval going forward ...
1st Nations need to give prior and informed consent on ALL development projects.  In areas where 1st peoples overlap, ALL must give that consent (no pitting one nation against another allowed).  Even the tiny stuff can be grouped in a development agreement grouping small things together, kind of a consultations of a vision 1st Nations accept after consolidations and their prior approval.  They need to be given resources and training during these consultations so they can make these informed decisions.  For activities that are on going, 1st nations consent must be granted there, not just for whose territory it is on, but for all people who could be affected downstream (open-penned fish farms and oil pipelines is a good example of things that can cause bad things that go beyond just one nation territory it sits on).
Species threatened must be given priority over all human activities, period.  There is lots of wealth, especially with the help of technology and knowledge to be had without continual rape of the environment.  Transition industries that cannot put threatened species above all else to give people jobs into something more respectful of the environment.  All new development and approvals for continued activities must put threatened species and ecosystems first, and people can use technology to find ways to compliment life style without threatening our future.  All of this also assumes marine animals too (from resident orcas, wild salmon, right whales, basking sharks, sea turtles, glass sponges, seals & sea lions, and beyond).
This is just to start.

I am writing today with regard to the Environmental Assessment Revitalization Discussion Paper.
As a British Columbian, I am deeply concerned about the cumulative effect of government policies and regulatory reviews are having on our energy sector and jobs in our province. The fact is, Canada is falling behind in the global race to attract oil and natural gas investment.
I believe we need fair rules to protect health, safety and the environment  but not rules that create undue costs, delay and overlap  or only apply to Canadian energy but not to foreign energy.
A predictable and clearly-defined regulatory environment is important in order to enhance investor confidence in Canadas oil and natural gas industry. Timely approval is an important benchmark needed to attract investment and promote reconciliation through economic development.
Further, establishing a predictable regulatory framework will be important to future liquefied natural gas projects required to undergo an environmental assessment.
Any changes to the existing environmental assessment review process must not result in unnecessary additional costs and be mindful of those costs already associated with doing business in Canada.

<sentencetext>89 I am going to a specific issue and will try to make this brief . The entirety of this issue is quite massive, complex and overwhelming. This is the bare bones as I see it.
 Pipelines and Oil
First, we can not function as a civilization today with out oil.  Maybe some day, maybe not . Even windmills, trains, trucks and tankers need oil.
Transportation needs it. There is nothing in anybody's  house that wasn't manufactured and moved there with out oil based fuel. Nothing.
 We also need the fossil fuels for heat. Nothing can replace the bulk necessary to heat Canada, the States or the world. There's near 8 billion people who need it , and that is what is the root of changing this planet is their basic needs. Nobody can get to or from anywhere now days with out fossil fuel transportation. Scooters, buses or planes. Walking or biking to Costo just won't work.
 There is no safer way or economical way to transport oil or gas than pipelines. They are in every province filled to capacity and moving the commodity 24 hrs a day in Canada now and the impact is near zero. There's not enough trucks to replace the pipelines.
 Trains, Trucks and tankers from all over the world are moving today and the cost, risks and carbon are subtantially more costly than pipelines . Spills from other than pipelines instantly head to the nearest body of water and adversely effect population.
 I'm retired and have no axe to grind as per se', and I did work in the oil industry in both BC and AB. I know the rigid safety and quality assurance there is putting those in the ground. 
 AB oil sands
 Mother Nature has created the largest catastrophic disaster in the world.   There are places on the Clear Water River where you step out of the boat and sink to you knees in gooey raw oil. That seeps into the Clear Water river and is not man made.  The clean up of it, and bitumen from it, leaves a pristine wild life environment. It is a win win situation as well as raised the lifestyle standard of  every person in Canada with the Royalty distribution  and immediate jobs which pay taxes.
 Buying imported oil off a boat from half way across the world in the Atlantic or the States is still needed to be transported to BC by pipeline.
 Keeping oil flowing to BC is essential and the most environmental friendly, safest cheapest closest Canadian benefiting way, is by pipelines from AB, especially if it originates in Northern BC .

This is the bare bones as I see it.<br/> Pipelines and Oil<br/>First, we can not function as a civilization today with out oil.  Maybe some day, maybe not . Even windmills, trains, trucks and tankers need oil.<br/>Transportation needs it. There is nothing in anybody&#39;s  house that wasn&#39;t manufactured and moved there with out oil based fuel. Nothing.<br/> We also need the fossil fuels for heat. Nothing can replace the bulk necessary to heat Canada, the States or the world. There&#39;s near 8 billion people who need it , and that is what is the root of changing this planet is their basic needs. Nobody can get to or from anywhere now days with out fossil fuel transportation. Scooters, buses or planes. Walking or biking to Costo just won&#39;t work.<br/> There is no safer way or economical way to transport oil or gas than pipelines. They are in every province filled to capacity and moving the commodity 24 hrs a day in Canada now and the impact is near zero. There&#39;s not enough trucks to replace the pipelines.<br/> Trains, Trucks and tankers from all over the world are moving today and the cost, risks and carbon are subtantially more costly than pipelines . Spills from other than pipelines instantly head to the nearest body of water and adversely effect population.<br/> I&#39;m retired and have no axe to grind as per se&#39;, and I did work in the oil industry in both BC and AB. I know the rigid safety and quality assurance there is putting those in the ground. <br/> AB oil sands<br/> Mother Nature has created the largest catastrophic disaster in the world.   There are places on the Clear Water River where you step out of the boat and sink to you knees in gooey raw oil. That seeps into the Clear Water river and is not man made.  The clean up of it, and bitumen from it, leaves a pristine wild life environment. It is a win win situation as well as raised the lifestyle standard of  every person in Canada with the Royalty distribution  and immediate jobs which pay taxes.<br/> Buying imported oil off a boat from half way across the world in the Atlantic or the States is still needed to be transported to BC by pipeline.<br/> Keeping oil flowing to BC is essential and the most environmental friendly, safest cheapest closest Canadian benefiting way, is by pipelines from AB, especially if it originates in Northern BC .<br/>Erle Martz<br/>Prince George<br/><br/>

<sentencetext>93 I am writing today with regard to the Environmental Assessment Revitalization Discussion Paper.
As a British Columbian, I am deeply concerned about the cumulative effect of government policies and regulatory reviews are having on our energy sector and jobs in our province. The fact is, Canada is falling behind in the global race to attract oil and natural gas investment.
I believe we need fair rules to protect health, safety and the environment  but not rules that create undue costs, delay and overlap  or only apply to Canadian energy but not to foreign energy.
A predictable and clearly-defined regulatory environment is important in order to enhance investor confidence in Canadas oil and natural gas industry. Timely approval is an important benchmark needed to attract investment and promote reconciliation through economic development.
Further, establishing a predictable regulatory framework will be important to future liquefied natural gas projects required to undergo an environmental assessment.
Any changes to the existing environmental assessment review process must not result in unnecessary additional costs and be mindful of those costs already associated with doing business in Canada.
Thanks for your attention to this matter.

<sentencetext>96 I've stated my location as Hermosillo Mexico. I'm there now. But it could have been Antofagasta, Chile or a Buca, Turkey or Uelzen, Germany or Missinipi, Saskatchewan.
I live in BC and raised my family there for most of their lives. But for the past 12 years of nearly a 45 year career in mining and mineral exploration, I have seen no meaningful work in the industry in BC. Thus, the millions of dollars that my Canadian client companies raise, to some degree from Canadian investors, has been spent in foreign countries.
A good part of the reason for so little work in the province is the uncertainty, delays, restrictions in and of permitting for mineral exploration. And without exploration, the mines that follow, along with the tax base, the bursaries, the scholarships, the summer jobs, the apprenticeships and industrial training and straight out high wages paid in a hinterland with few alternatives, is lost.
These issues are mentioned in the discussion paper, just as they have been mentioned in previous government studies for as long as I can remember as the industry slowly evaporated.
But ultimately, the real reason for the erosion of the industry in BC is the uncertainty or, more realistically, the inability to put a discovery into production. The investment in the sector has migrated to Google, Disney, Tesla and other fashionable alternatives largely because of an atmosphere of an over zealous regulatory regime that includes rabid environmental protection legislation. 
Further,  and at the risk of being labelled and discounted as a non-progressive politically backward social Luddite or simply as a bigot, an imposed over emphasis on native involvement in the industry and a perception by the investment community that the BC indigenous community is against resource development.
For decades, exploration relied on local 1st  nations for help in exploration camps. It was an informal arrangement where we would hire locals based on opportunity, experience and performance. As the years progressed, this evolved to a dictate by law and the relationship became an expected requirement, or, if I am allowed here in 2018 to be so politically and culturally insensitive, an entitlement expected of the companies. Job performance has become irrelevant and local first nations involvement has become largely a simple legal obligation.
In reading through the Discussion Paper, this is not a revitalization except as applied from the thesaurus of a government bureaucrat assigned to the project. It is simply a politically fashionable exercise of a government's intent to address their perception that the public has that indigenous issues are ignored by the resource industry.
That perception is far from being the truth.
The process for decades has been heavily weighted on indigenous involvement in all mineral exploration projects in BC. But over the years, this cooperative arrangement has been increasingly cemented by regulation and formal process. This discussion paper to me reads as a re-manufacturing and relabelling and an formal imposition of what as been a more cooperative effort.
But  the process appears heavily weighted against the resources industries. The component makeup of the EAO is unknown. But given the current flavour of the ecologically righteous, the biases that can be imposed based on political influence is a huge elephant sitting on the shoulders of the committee.
Given the results of past decisions on major resource issues (Tatsenshini, Muskwa-Ketchika, Taseko Resources and of course, recent denial of the need for a pipeline), the decisions have not favoured resource development.
Thirdly, requiring input from the public simply means that the organized machinery that has the means, mandate and backing, can and will continue to participate as the public feedback. The true general public has become so far removed from the reality and environmental cost of their lifestyles along with the corresponding media misinterpretation of resource issues in the province that this true public has a far too tainted (and ignorant) outlook on the resource industry to provide valid input.
So now we rely on our resource professionals to go to other countries to extract and bring back the resources we all, including the indigenous population, demand for our contemporary lifestyles, all the while we admire our untouched landscapes and wax poetic about traditional lifestyles. We don't take ownership of our own environmentally destructive consumer lifestyles and simply offload it to other countries.
This revitalization will simply be a new bureaucratic process of an older practice that other countries don't have. It is yet another reason the resource industry has walk away from the province.

<sentencetext>100 The so-called energy corridor needs to be instituted across Canada.
Why treat treat energy worse than international providers.
Without oil transfer payments from Alberta to the indigenous people and Quebec will be lessened.
Why let international eco-terrorists run the country. How naive.
Use our resources.  Our boreal forests are a bigger heat sink than our meagre impact on the planet.
